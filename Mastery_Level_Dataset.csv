HM,1,Spring,Observation,1,"As a future dentist and someone who has been to regular dental hygiene visits, a question I ask myself is: Why is there not a better, gentler, and more appealing way to apply fluoride to teeth? People tend to put things in their mouth that they like, that tastes good, thatâs sensory appealing, etc. Fluoride is the opposite. It has the most disgusting texture and taste, plus, you have to wait a certain amount of time to eat and drink. Not a single soul enjoys using it. Children and adults tend to steer away from getting fluoride at the dentist due to its bad taste and texture. This leads to bad dental practice and eventually bad dental health. In due course, bad dental health leads to more dental visits (fixes, surgeries, etc). Therefore, more money in the long run.

wonder about the benefits of opening more than one fry station to keep down the hustle and

 Problem - If youâre anything like me youâve been to a couple of different schools using a couple of different online learning formats, Iâve used Canvas, Blackboard and D2L and have found it can be somewhat difficult learning the new programs and software in order to succeed in the classroom. Now obviously this could be because of my own problems that I may need to fix and just figure out a way to deal with it, however I feel as though there is a better way.
Solution - What if there was a program that could be developed that allowed us to transfer the data and information from one online learning format into the format of your choosing. This would only change the format for the user, Not the teacher or the class.
For Example: I used Canvas for 5 years and became an expert in that online learning format when i transferred schools i had to learn a different program which made it somewhat difficult for me to figure out where assignments may be or where to turn them in, Sometimes I even discovered i was having trouble finding due dates for certain things and then started to fall behind.

AT,1,Fall,Observation,1,"Most expensive city to live in the nation: rent and living expenses becoming unaffordable
a. We have a one bedroom one bathroom apartment that is about 800 sq feet. Our
lease ends in December and luckily we will be moving out of the state of
California, but we received a notice from our complex saying if we decided to
resign, our rent would be almost $3000/month! That is almost a $500 difference
from what we are paying now. Studio apartments are priced at about
$2000/month, depending on the area of San Diego. One bedroom apartments are
about $3000/month, whereas two bedroom apartments are $4000+/month. This is
not including utilities or parking either. This is appalling for those of us that live
here, and probably for most people elsewhere to imagine as well. The problem is
that there is no rent regulation taking place and rent continues to increase to
numbers that are much higher than a living establishment is valued. This is
incredibly unfair and taking advantage of the people who need places to live and
are forced to spend their entire paycheck on housing. This also results in
homelessness and people being forced to live paycheck to paycheck and not being

a. At our apartment complex there are about 4 different dumpsters. For each

soared over $100/month. Weâve discussed this with a neighbor of ours who
noticed it first and brought it to our attention. None of us have received any
information regarding why the cost has increased. I am assuming that maybe the
garbage truck comes to collect the trash more often to keep up with the demand.
Or itâs possible that the complex is being charged for trash not inside the
dumpster. Either way, it is incredibly frustrating for those of us residents who
throw away a bag of trash once every week and donât over consume. I guess in an
attempt to keep it fair, residents are charged the same amount based on the bill
from the trash company. However, this is not fair for those of us who barely use

neighborhood
a. I wanted to add as I heard the people at the dog park talking about this issue.

ton of rules that residents are required to follow and adhere to, yet HOA doesnât

to be a gate that can only be opened by fob or gate code. The gate is supposed to
add an extra layer of security, as are security cameras, and a police officer doing
night patrol. Lately, the gate has been left open 24/7 due to it being broken. This
actually led to a home being broken into and the residents being robbed at
gunpoint. The security cameras have also been out of order for the past year. My
parents had their mailbox run over and no one was held accountable because the
cameras werenât working. My parents had to pay for a new mailbox on their own.

HM,1,Spring,Observation,2,"Leather: real, vegan, or lab grown? Throughout history, real leather has been âfarmedâ for 
customer approval and spending. The truth of real leather farming has come to light in the
recent years and made some customers turn to vegan leather. Real leather lasts for a long 
time and is biodegradable, so, sustainable whereas vegan leather is the opposite. It only 
lasts for a shorter period of time, takes many years to break down, and takes/releases 
many toxic and harmful chemicals into the atmosphere as well as the environment. 
Although some people turn a blind eye to the effects, others found a better way: lab 
grown leather. This type of leather is made from collagen rather than plastic and real 
animals. How can this type of leather become more common? How can we decrease the 
harm on our planet and what resides on it? Vegan leather companyâs need to be brought 
to light on their harmful products. Real leather farm practices need to be brought to light.

we werenât playing the music well by Thursday. One solution to ensuring the band is practicing and 
memorizing the music without having to take time out of band is to have an app that will remind each 
member to practice daily and require them to record themselves practicing for 10 minutes. This will hold 
each member accountable for memorization. This could be lucrative because creating the app would 
likely not cost that much and then one could charge each band a flat rate to use the app.",,,,,,,,Nice work!,,,

Target lost out on a potential sale because they didn't have any-- so maybe they should increase their shipment/stock of berries so they don't continue to lose more opportunities to sell berries.

I'm sure there are other college students that live with multiple other people that have the same issue.

Problem - I recieved a phone call from my friend today about his mental health while being a college athlete that not only made me feel bad for him cause I wish there was something I could do for him, It also got me thinking why is there no such thing as a college athlete mentor/coach to help these student athletes with these problems.

Solution - By hiring a Mental health coach for Student athletes around the country it would be a huge benefit for the college themselves as well as the athletes teachers parents and there team, It would most likeley enhance there playing ability and attitude, So many athletes around the country deal with this issue everyday including myself when I was a college athlete and could have seen myself using something like this often.",,,,,,,,"Great exploration of different ideas.

Solution - Automated mowing machine that can map your yard and mow it. Think of the robotic vacuums like the rumbas. Just like that but for grass, you could make different variations ranging from heavy duty to lawn up keep and believe this would be something that could sell, you could even make it so it could do other things Mulching, cleaning, cleaning leaves etc. This could be a time saver and a money maker.

MC,0,Spring,AI,3,"Prompt- business oppurtunities for college students

1. Stock Market because being a student athlete you work your own hours and there is other markets such as the futures market which is open longer than the normal market. 

2. Content creation because people love to see everything that goes on the the life of a student athlete and i have seen this work a lot with other athletes and some that i am friends with. 

3. Affiliate Marketing because as doing this you learn to market something that isn't yourself and also make a profit while doing it. 

4. dropshipping because you can sell whichever oroduct you would like and it is all on your own time and a large profit can be made

5. Online tutoring but i rank this at 5 because you have to know pretty much everything about whichever course you ar tutoring someone in. ",,,,,,,,So which one of these do you think you could pull off yourself? Ulltimately we are trying to train your brain to see entrepreneurial opportunities for not just anyone but for you specifically in case you want to pursue something.,,,
BG,1,Spring,AI,3," 1. What is something that could make an oven more efficient?
""Upgrading the insulation of the oven and optimizing the sealing machanisms around the door can significantly improve enery effciency by minimizing heat loss during cooking.""
I dont know much about heat conductions but depending on the oven you have, it can run up a gas/electric bill if you use it enough. This could be caused by heat leaking out. Creating an app that could tell you the effeciency of your oven and how it changes over time could be an opportunity. 
2. What could improve an apple watch?
"" Enhancements to the apple watch could include extended battery life, more advanced health tracking features, and additional customization options for watch faces and bands.""
If an apple watch could track your temperature, I think it would sell off the shelves. It could tell you when you are getting sick or even help women track their basil temperature. 
3. Create a business opportunity with blue light glasses
""A business opportynity could involved developing some customizable and stylish blue light glasses with presciption options. Additionally, providing a platform for virtual try-ons and personalized reccomendations based on users' screen time habits could set the business apart in the market.""
My initial thought was they do already offer an eyeglass option with blue light reflection, however the idea that you could adjust the amount of blue light reflection based off your screen time is a unique idea. This is not something the optometrist asks, and non-prescription blue light glasses are a ""one-size"" fits all type. 
4. Who would benefit from a waterproof marker?
""Professionals and enthusiasts in outfoor activities, construction workers, boaters, campers, hikers, and anyone working in wet or challenging enviorements would benefit from a waterproof marker. These markers could be valuable for tasks that invovle exposure to water, rain, or other adverse conditions ensuring that markings remain visible and durable.""
The idea is there. It would act almost as a permanent marker but it would have to dry almost immediately which could cause a lot of room for spelling and gramatical errors. The use and the market is there though!
5. What is an opportynity that would benefit the working middle class?
""Creating a platform or service that offers affordable and accessible financial education, budgeting tools, and resources could benefit the working middle class. Empowering individuals with financial literacy and practical tools can help them make informed decisions, save moneym and improve their overall financial welll-being.""
Platforms like Youtube do exist in this sense. However you could take it a step further and much like a ""Angies List"" or ""rover"" to walk your dog, you could hire someone for tutoring sessions through one safe platform that could be virtual or in person. ",,,,,,,,Nice analysis!,,,
HM,1,Spring,AI,3,"
1. âWinter Socks for Horseback Riding to Keep Your Toes Warmâ. Although this might 
seem like this has already been made, I have not found a product that I enjoy using. A 
sock product specifically for equestrians. When riding during the winter, you generally 
donât move your toes and they become frozen. Then you dismount your horse, and you 
feel like you broke your foot. This is not an ideal feeling. ChatGPT provided a list of 
factors in which this sock should have. This list includes wool/synthetic fabric, thickness,
moisture-wicking, height, seamless design, breathability, fit, brand recommendations, 
layering, and toe warmers. I agree for the most part of the list; however, I am not looking 
for brand recommendations. This new prototype of sock should include the majority of 
what is listed, but I would like to see an equestrian style sock â I mean I want design. I 
would like equine and equine related designs on the socks to be more appealing to the 
eye. ChatGPT had all of the right features (except the greater detailed design) for this 
opportunity. 
2. âA College Guide on How to Properly Compact Storageâ. Most students struggle with 
keeping their dorm room tidy due to the small space and large amount of stuff. A guide 
that covers how to pack items compactly to maximum storage in a small area would be a 
great benefit to every student. ChatGPT provides a step-by-step guide to help properly 
compact storage. This guide states that: planning and assessment (inventory and layout), 
investing in space-saving furniture (under-bed storage and folding furniture), modular 
shelves and storage units (stackable bins and boxes and modular shelving), using vertical 
space (over-the-door organizers and wall-mounted shelves), declutter and organize 
(minimalism and organizational tools), dual-purpose items (furniture with storage and 
bed with storage), labeling (clear labels and color coding), rotate seasonal items (seasonal
storage and swap out), utilize technology (digital storage and e-books and digital notes)m
and regular maintenance (purge unnecessary items and reassess organization) are all ways
to âmake the most of your college storage space and maintain a clutter-free and organized
living environmentâ. Although each step has significance, each one is not needed. If 
ChatGPT could compact this step-by-step guide into a brochure-like pamphlet or email, 
then I believe college students would be more likely to utilize it. A shorter (or more 
compact) version of this would be ideal for the average college student. 
3. âThird Party Purchases Through Student Account Billingâ. A third-party purchase does 
not let you pay through your student account (as I found out today). This source is a 
trusted source and labeled as a âPremier Partnerâ. If the trust is so valued, then why canât 
I pay for my books through my student account rather my debit card right then and there?
From ChatGPT, a list of considerations and some advice when this issue is at hand. As 
stated from ChatGPT, âthe ability to make third-party purchases through a student 
account billing system often depends on the policies and arrangements established by the 
educational institutionâ. This is most likely true for most education institutions. However,
it is extremely inconvenient and defeats the purpose of a student account. If the 
educational institutes were able to amend this issue, then they would receive less 

complaints on their end. The potential opportunity provided from ChatGPT is not worth 
evaluating further. 
4. âReinforced Umbrella Protectionâ. Does your umbrella ever go inside-out and break 
during a windy day? Does this happen a little too easily? This happens to me more often 
than Iâd like to admit, I spend more money on umbrellas than what is healthy. ChatGPT 
responded to this prompt by giving, yet another, list of features and advice. Each point 
given is significant when dreaming of a sturdier umbrella. Wind resistance, sturdy 
frames, double canopies, water-repellent fabric, UV protection, reinforced joints, auto 
open/close mechanism, rubberized handles, compact and portable design, and a warranty 
are a part of the provided list. One thing that could be added to this would be 
affordability. Therefore, a well-made (good quality) umbrella that is affordable for the 
middle-class. The cheap (really any umbrella) tends to break often, but if you want to 
trick yourself into buying a more expensive one (that will still break the same) then go for
it. However, ChatGPTâs new sturdier umbrella potential is more appealing. 
5. âDental Office Plans for Calming Waiting Patientsâ. Many people are afraid of the 
dentist, they get anxious just in the waiting rooms. A calm and comfortable environment 
would be ideal for any practice for the well-being of the patients. Most dental offices 
already practice this; however, I have not heard of using aromatherapy or informational 
displays. ChatGPT has this potential opportunity down as in it is thorough, correct, and 
follows the general practice of dental offices. As mentioned, the difference between a real
setting of a dental office and the ChatGPT provided one is the use of aromatherapy and 
informational displays. Informational displays provide a distraction from the real setting. 
Aromatherapy provides a calming effect as studies have proved. This is a great 

opportunity to follow through with when looking to be unique and succeed with a dental 
office. 
Alertness Rubric Ranking (from 1 through 5, 1 being the best and 5 being the worst): 
1. Dental Office Plans for Calming Waiting Patients
2. Winter Socks for Horseback Riding to Keep Your Toes Warm
3. A College Guide on How to Properly Compact Storage
4. Reinforced Umbrella Protection
5. Third Party Purchases Through Student Account Billing",,,,,,,,"So this is one of the few times you'd be penalized (this is just your warning) for doing your work early. Remember the point of these is the daily practice so that spaced repetition helps create the new habit. Granted you did one in the morning and one and night so it could have been worse but know as a general rule if it is turned in on the same day as another practice assignment you'll only receive half credit.

A usual result from ChatGPT, a lengthy, detailed response with some predictable ideas, some irrelavant ideas, and a possibly good idea. 

I would personally rank them, from least innovative to most innovative, as follows:

Problem: Traffic Commute

Invention/Solution: Smart Traffic Management System
I see this as an issue that has already, mostly to the best of our ability, been managed. Traffic lights are already on schedules, use sensors, and more to optimise the flow of traffic. 


Problem: Energy Wastage at Home

Invention/Solution: Smart Home Energy Management System
While not used for energy saving purposes, It is possible nearly completely outfit your home with 'smart' technology. Products like Alexa and Alexa-compatible appliances can work together to either automate or monitor nearly anything inside an average home. 


Problem: Lost Keys or Wallet

Invention/Solution: Bluetooth Tracking Devices
This is a very innovative idea to combat a very common inconvenience: misplacing important personal items. Fortunately, products with this exact concept in mind are already widely availible to purchase, such as Apple's AirTags. 


Problem: Food Spoilage

Invention/Solution: Smart Refrigerator with Inventory Tracking
While smart home appliances already exist, a refrigerator that can actively monitor and keep inventory of perishable foods is still yet to be fully realized for consumer markets. While a technologically challenging prospect, this idea still holds great potential.


Problem: Lack of Access to Healthcare Information

Invention/Solution: Telehealth Platforms with AI-Assisted Symptom Checker
On the topic of AI, a personal assistant that can actively learn about your health issues, diets, and symptoms could be revolutionary, especially when trained on the unfathomable amount of reliable medical data availible worldwide.

more sensitive information get uploaded and everyone deserves some internet security.",,,,,,,,Nice!,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,3,"What I said: âgenerate the 5 opportunities, what the output was, and your assessment of the 
potential opportunity. Rank them from best to worst opportunityâ
Prompt 1: âExploring unmet needs in a remote work setting.â
Challenges faced during remote collaboration, such as difficulty in gauging team morale, lack of 
spontaneous interactions, or issues with project visibility.
This opportunity covers an everyday problem in today's workplace. It's possible that a new 
product or service will improve remote teamwork. The growing trend of remote work must be 
taken into account when calculating the market size. One or more of the current collaborative 
tools could be competitors. A software platform or app with possible income structures like 
subscriptions or per-user fees could be the solution.
Prompt 2: ""Highlight problems with traditional mental health support.""
Challenges individuals face with access, stigma, or effectiveness of traditional mental health 
support methods.
This talks about a common problem that has a big emotional impact. Considering the rising 
awareness of mental health, the market is large. Apps for mental health or traditional therapy 
services could be competitors. A fresh approach to therapy, support groups, or apps for mental 
wellness that rely on in-app sales or subscriptions for income could be the answer.
Prompt 3: ""Investigate complaints about inefficient public transportation.""
frustrations related to delays, lack of real-time information, or uncomfortable conditions in 
public transportation.
This deals with what many people go through on a regular basis. In cities, the market size could 
be enormous. Current transportation providers are competitors. A tech platform with real-time 
updates, better infrastructure, or creative transportation solutions with per-ride fees, advertising, 
or subscription models might all be part of the solution.
Prompt 4: ""Identify emerging trends in sustainable living.""

Insights into the increasing demand for eco-friendly products, waste reduction, or sustainable 
living practices.
This talks about a growing tendency in environmental awareness that has emotional importance. 
Because more people are leading sustainable lifestyles, the market is growing. Suppliers of 
environmentally friendly products are competitors. Developing or marketing sustainable goods 
and services using revenue streams like product sales, subscriptions, or partnerships could be 
part of the answer.
Prompt 5: ""Explore unmet needs in personalized fitness and wellness.""
frustrations with generic workout plans, lack of motivation, or difficulties in tracking 
personalized fitness goals.
This talks about an everyday event that has emotional connections to one's wellbeing. The 
market is sizable given the growing emphasis on wellness and health. Fitness apps and 
customized training services are competitors. A cutting-edge fitness app, customized coaching 
plans, or smart exercise equipment with in-app purchases, subscriptions, or device sales might all
be part of the solution.
Ranking:
1. Remote Work Collaboration
2. Mental Health Support
3. Efficient Public Transportation
4. Sustainable Living
5. Personalized Fitness and Wellness
Reasoning: The ranking is based on the emotional impact, market size, feasibility, and alignment
with emerging trends. The top-ranked opportunity addresses the enormous rising popularity of 
remote work and how crucial it is for companies to incorporate a strong protocol within their 
businesses",,,,,,,,So which do you think you personally could pull off? That is also part of the opportunity evaluation process. Figuring out the ones you can do or the ones you know someone who you could recruit to do.,,,
KS,1,Spring,AI,3,"
Prompt: Give me 5 Business Opportunities
Virtual Events and Experiences:
With the rise of remote work and digital connectivity, there's a growing demand for virtual events and 
experiences. You could start a business that organizes virtual conferences, webinars, and online 
workshops, or even offers virtual tourism experiences.
My assessment: I think this is a decently good opportunity. Technology has been playing a huge role in 
how we work and experience things because of the pandemic. 4 years later, it is now permanently 
incorporated into work culture. People would benefit from this opportunity heavily because of the 
demand for remote experiences and the easy usage of things online. This business venture would leave 
people satisfied and content. With there being so many online nowadays, to attract new people and to 
garner a loyal customer base, there would have to be a new and creative aspect of doing virtual events and
experiences. 
E-Learning Platforms:
The education landscape is evolving, and there's a significant demand for online learning platforms. 
Consider creating a platform that offers courses, tutorials, or educational content in specific niches. You 
can focus on professional development, skill-based learning, or academic subjects.
My assessment: Along with virtual events and experiences business, I think this would also be a good 
opportunity because of where schooling culture has gone due to the pandemic. It has slowed down in the 
K-12 realm of school, but college heavily relies on online services to produce classes, class materials, and
an easier way for people to get degrees without having to physically attend school. I think this business 
opportunity would also leave people, specifically students and faculty, extremely satisfied. 
Personalized Health and Nutrition Services:
Tailoring health and nutrition plans to individual needs is gaining popularity. Start a business that offers 
personalized meal plans, fitness routines, or health consultations based on an individual's unique 
requirements. This could involve leveraging technology like AI to analyze data and provide customized 
recommendations.
My assessment: This business opportunity would be good...if it was a new and creative concept that has 
never been seen before. There are so many personalized health and nutrition services on the market right 
now that a new one would get lost in the sea of others. It would take an innovative concept to grab the 
attention of people and gain enough customers to have a steady business. 
Subscription Boxes for Niche Markets:
Subscription box services have gained popularity in recent years. Identify a niche market that is 
passionate about a particular hobby, interest, or lifestyle, and create a subscription box service that 
delivers curated products related to that niche regularly.
My assessment: This would not be a good business opportunity because it is not plausible to create a 
business out of a niche market, especially one that requires a subscription and monthly payment. Now this
could vary on the type of niche market and the amount of following it has. It also can depend on whether 
the niche market already has something similar, which would create competition among the businesses. 

Content Creation and Influencer Marketing Agency:
As social media continues to play a significant role in marketing, starting an agency that connects brands 
with influencers or creates engaging content for businesses can be a lucrative venture.
My assessment: With TikTok being a predominant part of our culture and society, comes along the rise of 
content creators and influencers. This business opportunity could be a great idea. There isnât something 
like this thatâs already out there and there is a huge need for some organization in the influencer world. 
This could satisfy tons of content creators and influencers along with satisfying brands because it will be 
easier to connect with potential partners and collaborations. 
Ranking: 
1. Content Creation and Influencer Marketing Agency
2. Virtual Events and Experiences
3. E-Learning Platforms
4. Personalized Health and Nutrition Services
5. 
Subscription Boxes for Niche Markets ",,,,,,,,Nice! In the future Chat GPT assignments try to have it articulate enough that you feel like you could actually implement the idea.,,,
MA,0,Fall,AI,3,"I typed in; Give me 5 modern business oppurtunities that could make me money fast.

Ranked from worst to best

1.Eco-Friendly Products and Services: With the increasing focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility, businesses that offer eco-friendly products and services are in high demand. You could start a business that specializes in sustainable fashion, renewable energy solutions, or zero-waste packaging, for example.

Assessment: I think this one is smart especially considering what sells in todays market, but it is just too broad of a topic and doesn't give further information other than the product type.
2.Remote Work Solutions: The shift towards remote work has accelerated in recent years, and businesses that provide remote work solutions are in demand. You could create a company that offers software for remote team collaboration, ergonomic home office furniture, or remote work training and consulting services.

Assessment: This one is good but highly competitive being that the top companies for these programs are microsoft and google, it's just hard to beat the people who are already a monopoly in this industry.
3.Health and Wellness: The health and wellness industry continues to grow, with opportunities in areas like fitness, mental health, and nutrition. You might consider opening a gym, offering online mental health counseling, or selling healthy meal kits.

Assessment: This one is highly profitable in my opinion, it's wrong to say but peoples's mental health has plummeted overall since the recent boom in the social media industry, this would be an easy oppurtunity to jump in on.
4.Tech-Related Services: Technology is constantly evolving, and businesses that offer tech-related services, such as cybersecurity, data analysis, and software development, are in demand. You could start a cybersecurity consultancy, a data analytics firm, or a software development company.

Assessment: This one is obvious especially with AI becoming so popular jumping on an oppurtunity to use these new technologies to your advantage could be what alot of entrepreneaurs are going to start doing.
5.Personalized E-commerce: E-commerce is a booming industry, and personalized e-commerce is a niche with great potential. This can involve creating personalized product recommendations, customized merchandise, or even subscription box services tailored to individual preferences.

Assessment: I put this as the best because everyone can do it, I could teach my Mom how to dropship in a day and she could make a couple grand a month if she focused on it for 2 hours a day.",,,,,,,,"Nice work! Ultimately what makes an opportunity a ""good"" one is if you will take action on it and we usually don't do that unless we are interested and can do something to make it happen.

Or you could also consider how ChatGPT could be use in these opportunities.",,,
MB,1,Fall,AI,3,"Order of what I believed to be good business opportunities: #2, #3, #4, #5, #1

â¢ 
Pricing strategy: Determine an appropriate pricing strategy that aligns with the perceived 
value of the device and is competitive within the market. Consider whether you want to 
adopt a one-time purchase model, a subscription-based model, or a combination of both, 
and ensure that the pricing structure is sustainable for the long term.
â¢ Marketing and distribution: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to create 
awareness and generate interest in your product. Consider the most effective channels for 
reaching your target audience, such as online advertising, social media, and partnerships 
with relevant businesses. Additionally, establish an efficient distribution network to 
ensure that your device is readily accessible to potential customers.
â¢ User feedback and improvement: Plan to collect feedback from early users to 
continuously improve the device's functionality and user experience. Implement regular 
updates and enhancements based on user suggestions and emerging technological 
advancements to stay competitive and relevant in the market.

depends on its ability to address a genuine market need, offer unique and valuable features, 
ensure data security, employ an effective pricing strategy, and maintain a customer-centric 
approach to product development and marketing.

Assessment: ChatGPTâs answer to whether opportunity is good seemed like the opportunity only 
had a certain success rate if I took everything into consideration. This business opportunity 
didnât seem as promising as others because of its generalization.
Opportunity #2-- Is providing a service that helps plan successful fundraisers for organizations a 
good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Providing a service that helps plan successful fundraisers for organizations 
can indeed be a promising business opportunity, especially considering the ongoing need for 
fundraising in various sectors. Here are some key points to consider when evaluating this 
business idea:
â¢ Market demand: Evaluate the current demand for fundraising services within different 
sectors, such as non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and community groups. 
Research the challenges these organizations face in planning successful fundraisers and 
determine whether there is a viable market for a specialized service that addresses these 
needs.
â¢ Expertise and network: Assess your expertise in event planning, particularly in the 
context of fundraising events. Consider whether you have the necessary skills and 
experience to effectively manage various aspects of event organization, including 
budgeting, venue selection, marketing, and donor engagement. Additionally, evaluate the 
strength of your professional network and connections within the non-profit and 
fundraising communities, as this can significantly influence the success of your business.

to potential clients. Utilize both online and offline channels, including social media, 
networking events, and industry conferences, to showcase your expertise and establish 
your credibility within the fundraising community. Consider offering informative 
resources, such as blog posts, case studies, and whitepapers, to demonstrate your 
knowledge and capabilities in successful fundraiser planning.
â¢ 
Pricing and profitability: Determine a pricing structure that reflects the value of your 
services and remains competitive within the market. Consider whether you will charge a 
flat fee, a percentage of the funds raised, or a combination of both, and ensure that your 
pricing is sustainable and profitable for your business in the long term.
â¢ Legal and ethical considerations: Familiarize yourself with the legal and ethical 
regulations related to fundraising and event planning, including any licensing 
requirements or compliance standards that may apply to your business. Ensure that you 
maintain transparency and integrity in your dealings with clients and adhere to all 
relevant laws and guidelines governing fundraising activities.

fundraising and event planning. Continuously seek feedback from clients and participants 
to identify areas for improvement and refine your services accordingly. Embrace 
innovation and adapt your strategies to meet the evolving needs and preferences of your 
clients and the fundraising industry as a whole.
By focusing on these key aspects, you can position your business as a valuable resource for 
organizations seeking to plan successful fundraisers, thereby establishing a strong and 
sustainable presence in the fundraising services market.
Assessment: I would specifically peruse this business because there is a needed market for it and 
it requires me to branch out the least to other experts.
Opportunity #3-- Is creating a cook book specifically geared toward college students and taking 
into account a college students diet, budget, skill set, and limited time a good business 
opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a cookbook tailored to college students that considers their diet, 
budget, skill set, and limited time can indeed be a promising business opportunity. Here are some 
key points to consider when evaluating this business idea:
â¢ Market demand: Evaluate the demand for this type of cookbook by researching the eating 
habits and cooking needs of college students. Understand the challenges they face in 
terms of limited time, budget constraints, and the desire for simple and healthy meals. 
Analyze whether there is a gap in the market for a cookbook that addresses these specific 
needs.
â¢ Unique value proposition: Develop a cookbook that offers simple, affordable, and 
nutritious recipes tailored to the limited resources and culinary skills of college students. 
Focus on providing creative and practical meal ideas that are easy to prepare within a 
short time frame and with readily available ingredients. Consider including tips for meal 
planning, grocery shopping on a budget, and utilizing basic kitchen equipment.
â¢ Target audience engagement: Establish a strong connection with the college student 
demographic by engaging with them through various channels, such as social media, 
online forums, and campus events. Encourage feedback and suggestions to ensure that the 
cookbook's content resonates with their preferences and lifestyle. Consider conducting 
surveys or focus groups to gather insights and refine your cookbook's content 
accordingly.
â¢ Marketing and distribution: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that targets 
college students through relevant platforms and channels, such as student-oriented 
websites, campus publications, and social media influencers. Consider partnering with 
college organizations, student unions, or campus stores to promote and distribute the 
cookbook effectively. Additionally, explore online marketplaces and e-commerce 
platforms to reach a broader audience beyond college campuses.
â¢ Visual appeal and user-friendliness: Ensure that the cookbook's design and layout are 
visually appealing and easy to navigate, catering to the preferences and attention spans of 
college students. Incorporate engaging visuals, step-by-step instructions, and cooking tips 
to enhance the user experience and encourage students to explore and experiment with 
the recipes.

â¢ Budget-friendly pricing: Determine an affordable price point for the cookbook that aligns 
with the budget constraints of college students. Consider offering digital formats, such as 
e-books or mobile apps, in addition to physical copies, to provide students with flexible 
and cost-effective options for accessing the cookbook.
â¢ Continual adaptation and expansion: Stay updated with current food trends, dietary 
preferences, and nutritional guidelines to ensure that the cookbook's content remains 
relevant and appealing to the evolving tastes of college students. Continuously expand 
the cookbook's offerings by incorporating seasonal recipes, special occasion menus, and 
versatile meal options to cater to a diverse range of dietary needs and preferences.
By focusing on these key aspects, you can establish a valuable and sought-after resource for 
college students looking to prepare convenient, budget-friendly, and nutritious meals, thereby 
capitalizing on a promising business opportunity within the niche cookbook market.
Assessment: ChatGPTâs answer to this opportunity seemed to be more enthusiastic about the 
idea being successful and mentioned how I would be capitalizing on a sought-after resource. One 
thing I really need to take into consideration for this business venture is being able to tailor the 
book to college students while still generalizing it enough for all students to be able to use it. 
This could be solved by providing varying degrees of recipes within the cookbook or coming out 
with a series of cookbooks (ex: beginner vs advanced, dinner vs lunch). I would consider this 
opportunity because as a college student myself I could make fair assessments on the recipeâs 
successes

what your career should be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a service or test that evaluates an individual's full set of skills and

Assessment: ChatGPTâs final response said that this opportunity could be lucrative. The 
suggestions/input it provided were very helpful to take into consideration when creating this 
business. This includes consulting experts and collaborating with learning institutions to ensure 
the test is successful. If done well, this test would be successful, however, one has to take into 
account the costs of consulting experts and making constant improvements and updates on the 
test to make it accurate.
Opportunity #5-- Is creating a simulation that helps you practice marching band drill a good 
business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a simulation that helps individuals practice marching band drill can 
be a unique and potentially valuable business opportunity, particularly for marching band 
participants, instructors, and enthusiasts. Consider the following factors when evaluating this 
business idea:
â¢ Market demand: Assess the demand for a marching band drill simulation among 
marching band participants, schools, and organizations. Identify whether there is a need 

for a virtual platform that enables individuals to practice and refine their marching 
techniques and routines, especially during off-seasons or when access to physical 
rehearsal spaces is limited.
â¢ Realism and interactivity: Develop a simulation that accurately replicates the experience 
of performing in a marching band, focusing on elements such as formations, step 
patterns, music synchronization, and coordination with fellow band members. Emphasize 
interactivity and real-time feedback to provide users with a realistic and engaging 
practice environment that enhances their skills and performance.
â¢ Customization and adaptability: Incorporate features that allow users to customize the 
simulation based on their specific marching band drill requirements, such as adjusting 
tempo, altering formations, and modifying difficulty levels. Provide options for users to 
practice different types of routines and styles, catering to the diverse needs and 
preferences of marching band programs and individuals with varying skill levels.
â¢ Educational resources: Integrate educational resources, tutorials, and instructional 
materials within the simulation to support users in understanding fundamental marching 
techniques, music interpretation, and performance dynamics. Offer comprehensive 
learning modules that cover topics such as posture, marching cadences, choreography, 
and ensemble coordination, enhancing the overall educational value of the simulation.
â¢ User engagement and community building: Foster a supportive online community where 
users can share experiences, exchange tips, and collaborate with other marching band 
enthusiasts. Implement features that encourage social interaction, such as virtual 
competitions, collaborative drills, and live feedback sessions, to promote user 
engagement and foster a sense of camaraderie among participants.
â¢ Accessibility and compatibility: Ensure that the simulation is accessible across various 
devices and platforms, enabling users to practice anytime and anywhere with ease. 
Optimize the simulation for compatibility with desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and 
mobile devices, allowing users to seamlessly integrate practice sessions into their daily 
routines and rehearsal schedules.
â¢ Collaboration with marching band programs: Establish partnerships with marching band 
programs, schools, and instructors to promote the simulation as a supplementary training 
tool and educational resource within the marching band community. Collaborate with
experienced marching band directors and educators to integrate the simulation into 
existing curriculum and training programs, enhancing the learning outcomes and 
performance capabilities of participating students and performers.
By considering these key factors, you can develop a valuable and innovative simulation platform 
that serves as an effective training tool for individuals passionate about marching band 
performance, thereby capitalizing on a unique business opportunity within the music education 
and entertainment industry.
Assessment: ChatGPTâs suggestions to make this a successful business were very useful. Taking

JC,0,Fall,AI,3,"1. Prompt: ""Generate a business opportunity related to sustainable energy solutions.""
Output: ""A startup that develops affordable and efficient solar-powered water heaters for
residential use.""
Assessment: Given that it addresses the rising need for sustainable energy solutions, 
this prospect seems potential. Carbon footprints and energy expenses can be 
decreased using solar-powered water heaters. Such a product has a market and fits in 
with the environmental trends of the day.
2. Prompt: ""Generate a business opportunity in the healthcare industry.""
Output: ""A telemedicine platform that connects patients with specialized doctors for 
remote consultations and diagnosis.""
Assessment: The use of telemedicine has grown significantly, particularly since the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This is an opportunity to take advantage of the demand for easily 
available and convenient healthcare services. Nonetheless, there is fierce competition, 
so success would hinge on savvy marketing and collaborations with medical experts.
3. Prompt: ""Create a business idea related to the gig economy.""
Output: ""A platform that connects freelance fitness instructors with individuals seeking 
personalized virtual workouts.""
Assessment: While the gig economy is expanding, many people still place a high value 
on their health and wellbeing. By arranging virtual exercises between fitness instructors 
and clients, this potential presents a distinctive niche. With the correct marketing plan 
and teacher incentives, it might work.
4. Prompt: ""Generate a business opportunity related to home automation.""
Output: ""A smart home security system that uses AI to identify and respond to potential 
threats, such as break-ins or fires.""

seeking unique adventures.""
Assessment: The pandemic has presented issues for the travel industry, but as

2. Healthcare telemedicine platform
3. Gig economy (Virtual fitness instructor platform)
4. Home automation (AI-driven security system)
5. Travel and tourism (Curated solo travel experiences)
Interest in Pursuing:
The prospect pertaining to sustainable energy solutionsânamely, solar-powered water 
heatersâpiques my interest the most because it fits in with current environmental 
trends and has the ability to meet a pressing need. There is competition in the 
healthcare telemedicine market, but the platform shows promise as well. Although they 
have potential, the gig economy and home automation options need to be used 
carefully. The current uncertainty in the travel and tourist business may make the 
opportunity difficult.",,,,,,,,"Great job assessing the market trends and competitive landscape!

MD,1,Fall,AI,3,"âWhat are five business opportunities that could solve everyday problems?â

 
Output One: Home Food Delivery And Meal Prep Services. 

 
 
This is indeed a very profitable business opportunity. Everyone is looking to simplify  their life, and cooking meals everyday is something that a lot of people see as a chore. I know that I feel very frustrated when I have to come home after a busy day, figure out what to cook, make it and then clean up. And I know that others feel the same way because of the success of companies such as DoorDash, InstaCart, HelloFresh etc.  The market for this type of opportunity does seem very oversaturated by this point, but still a good opportunity!

 
 
Output Two: Eco Friendly Products And Services (Such as reusable packing or renewable energy sources)

 
 
It is true that consumers are looking to lessen their negative impact on the environment. There are a lot of different ways to tap into that market, and a lot of businesses seem to have already done it by either labeling their products as more earth friendly, or by donating some of their proceeds to an eco friendly organization. I know that this is a concern for people, because why else would so many companies start selling eco-friendly products? If something is truly eco-friendly, itâs likely not as profitable, so businesses wouldnât push out a product like that for no reason. Consumers feel more comfortable buying products that wonât negatively impact the planet. 

 
 
Output Three: Mental Health And Wellness Services

 
 
I can definitely see that there could be some really progressive innovation in the mental health and wellness field for the future. Even since COVID, online therapy services have skyrocketed. Mental struggles weigh on the majority of peopleâs minds, and I think that it would be a great business opportunity as well as just good for the population to continue to innovate in that field. People are constantly looking for more affordable or easier ways to attend therapy, so I think that itâs a great idea that companies have started to pivot in that direction. 

 
 
Output Four: Elderly Care And Aging In Place Solutions

 
 
I can see the need for innovation in this type of business. I have seen a lot of people sound very overwhelmed and frustrated in the way that they talk about their parents being in an assisted living home or other elderly care facility for example. There is a lot of room for improvement in the way that these facilities could be run or even how they could be modified to keep someone closer to their home and family.

 
 
Output Five: Remote Work Solutions

 
 
This is another good one because in the last few years remote work has gotten increasingly popular. Iâve heard a lot of people express joy about their remote job or even a hybrid job. I think that there is a lot of room for innovation in letting more people work from home. This would be enjoyable for employees because they can spend more time with their families at home, and would be profitable for the companies because they donât have to pay for rent and utilities in a building that people use everyday.

Output: Certainly, here are five common daily problems that can be turned into entrepreneurial 
opportunities:
1. 
Time Management and Productivity: Many people struggle with time management and staying 
productive. You could start a business offering time management apps, online productivity 
courses, or personal coaching services to help individuals better manage their time and tasks.
2. 
Meal Planning and Cooking: Planning meals and cooking can be time-consuming and 
challenging for many. Consider launching a meal kit delivery service, a cooking class platform, or

that offers fitness training programs, wellness apps, healthy meal delivery services, or 
personalized health coaching to help individuals achieve their health goals.

Stress and Mental Well-being: Stress and mental health challenges are common daily issues. 
Consider launching a business that offers stress reduction workshops, mindfulness apps, or 
subscription-based mental health resources like therapy or meditation sessions.
As for opportunities that I would like to pursue, I could see myself starting some sort of stress or 
wellbeing business that focused on wellbeing coaching/therapy with an emphasis on stress and 
mindfulness. I could see this being a successful business because there has been a steep increase in the 
demand for mental health services, and I am majoring in psychology myself so I would feel somewhat 
qualified to start it up. I feel like I am very passionate about mindfulness and the fact that it is a growing 
economy makes it all tie together quite nicely. I think a lot of people struggle with mental health and 
managing their stress so this business would have a large audience. I think it would be able to turn a 
profit after a while through workshops and 1 on 1 coaching sessions because of the large demand and 
audience especially if it were mostly based online because of the ability to become widespread globally. ",,,,,,,,Well done! Ultimately what makes an opportunity a good one is one that you would want to do and could do. Try noticing just opportunities in the mental health space tomorrow.,,,

Here is the order in which I rank them based on the number: 3, 2, 5, 4, 1 

I personally think that all of these are really great ideas. I've never used ChatGPT before so this is really interesting to me. With it becoming more common, I think it's good to get a good handle on how it works so I'm not behind later on in my career (I am a Public Relations major, and I've heard from some people/companies that it would be beneficial to gain an understanding on how ChatGPT works-- obviously not to abuse its capabilites or anything like that, but just be aware of the ways it can be used). 

Anyways, I really like the personalized health and fitness coaching opportunity and the virtual event planning opportunity. I feel like in general, I have noticed people becoming more health-focused, and I think this might have something to do with living in a ""post-pandemic"" era-- I think the pandemic made a lot of people realize just how important their health is, and inspire them to improve it. I also like the virtual event planning idea a lot because so many companies and organizations do virtual workshops/conferences and things of that nature nowadays, and I think that would be a really beneficial service that a lot of people would like to have access to. 

I think the urban farming opportunity is a unique and smart idea, but I personally don't think it would be as successful as some of the other opportunities mentioned. There are so many outside factors that can play into farming such the weather, and success of the crop/plant growth-- so I think it's a bit more risky than some of the other ideas.

packaging.
Emotion Intensity: High (environmental consciousness and satisfaction).
Frequency: Regular.
Assessment: There's a significant opportunity to develop and market eco-friendly packaging 
solutions. 
Ranking of opportunities from best to worst: 
Great Experience/Opportunity #5 - Eco-Friendly Packaging - High emotional impact and 
frequent occurrence.
Problem/Opportunity #4 - Traffic Congestion - High emotional impact and frequent occurrence.
Problem/Opportunity #3 - Food Allergies - Moderate emotional impact and occasional 
occurrence
.
Problem/Opportunity #2 - Long Waiting Times at the Doctor's Office - Moderate to high

Ultimately what makes an opportunity a ""good"" one is if you will take action on it and we usually don't do that unless we are interested and can do something to make it happen.

CR,0,Fall,AI,3,"What I typed in was 5 Successful business ideas for young entrepreneurs.

This is what it came up with.

1. Virtural Reality Experience center

Chat GPT basically describes this as a center that would allow people to emerse themselves into anything want. For example: buying a new house and they want to test it out, Or looking to go on vacation but want to see if the hotel your staying at is worth while, Or even silly things like gaming or other sports and concepts that could be used for fun.

I rank this at number 1 because of the vast intriguing thoughts and expirences we all gain from VR ( virtual Reality ) and the popularity from VR is only growing, If you can combine the two things of something people want and something people may need i believe that could be seen as a real money maker. You can easily use this to benefit the good of the people help them test the waters on certain things before actually having to do it or committ to it. While also allowing for fun expiriences and other oppurtunites. I believe we have already seen certain things like that with golf simulators or baseball simulators but we have never actually been emersed in it.

2. Personalized Health and wellness services 

Chat GPT describes this as a place where people could go for any sort of Health or wellness need from nutrition and fitness to mental health and therapy by combining these things that people deal with often, People now day are increasingly becoming more concerned with there health allowing for something like this to be on high demand.

I might be somewhat biased towards this one, I believe alot can be said about health and wellness in our world today and looking into it not only could be a huge benefit for everyone around us but also a real money maker. IN my 5 ideas i wrote that colleges should have something somewhat like this and that it would be a big benefit for alot of people. So i rank this as the second best business oppurtunity idea from ChatGPT.

3. Eco Friendly product store

Start a business that focuses on selling eco-friendly and sustainable products. This could include items like reusable water bottles, organic skincare products, biodegradable packaging, or energy-efficient gadgets. With the growing awareness about environmental issues, there's a rising demand for such products. 

This is a little bit of a stretch but I see where the value is in this, the demand for things like this has gone way up in the past decade due to people starting to be more concerned about the envirement and the health of oursleves and the earth. something like this could be really appealing, However I do think something like this is also costly and could be a hard start up in the begining and you would have alot of things you would need to focus on marketing wise to make a store like this worth while and a money maker. Retail and Wholesale businesses can be successful and especially when there is a need ( which this does have ) which is why it could be successful.

4. Online learning platform for niche skills.

Develop an online platform that offers courses and tutorials for niche skills. This could be anything from gourmet cooking and digital marketing to specialized crafts or coding in unique programming languages. Many people are willing to pay for high-quality, specialized knowledge that they can learn at their own pace.

In theory this sounds really cool and something i could 100% get on board with but it also seems a little far out. I understand the need for education especailly for niche skills however I dont know if it is super realistic. More and more people around the world are catching on to the fact that education isnt everything expirnece is and although many people will pay for knowledge if it something they enjoy doing, there are lots of other ways of learning.

5. Tech repair and support services 

Start a business that provides tech repair and support services. This could include repairing smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other gadgets. Additionally, you can offer technical support services for software-related issues. As technology continues to advance, there's a constant need for reliable and trustworthy tech support.

This is ranked last because this is already a thing. Ive seen lots of places like these and they are successful. However the need for them is obviously not as much as the other things as well as this isnt a new idea and this isnt something you could trademark. The way you would make money from a business like this is by being the best at it and offering the best service and quickest service.

Something that I would be interested in doing would definitley be the first two i could see both of those ideas actually turning into something and making me money, they seem like they have a need and a want included in them and could be valuable to society which ultimatly makes a business worth starting, Value brings customers and customers bring money.",,,,,,,,"Nice work!

GS,1,Fall,AI,3,"Opportunities within playing professional baseball - there was a lot of output for the opportunities within playing professional baseball. It listed minor leagues, independent leagues, college baseball, international leagues, tryouts and showcases, drafts and signings, winter leagues, overseas leagues, skills development, physical conditioning, mental toughness, networking and representation, perseverance, position versatility, showcasing leadership, self-promotion as all the opportunities within playing professional baseball. I find some of those to be qualities, not opportunities that professional baseball players should have. Within that, minor and Major League Baseball players would have the most income and therefore be the best option, but not many people make it to that level, making it a hard-to-reach opportunity. 


A broad, âwedding photographerâ generation. Although it was such a broad input, I feel as if the AI gave a good breakdown of what goes into it. It listed skills and equipment, portfolio development, business and branding, marketing and client acquisition, client consultations, planning and preparation, day of coordination, creativity and storytelling, post-production, client delivery, customer service and reviews, and continued education as all things that go into being a wedding photographer. What it didnât list or even mention was the monetary value of being a wedding photographer. Although a wedding photographer can easily make 6+ figures, as AI mentioned, a lot of continued experience, education, updated equipment, and more goes into it. 


social media content wedding day creation - Iâm pleasantly surprised at how much AI has information for this. I felt that I was pretty specific for the search yet it gave 17 bullet points for it. One thing that it again doesnât say is the monetary value in it. 


tiktok social media content wedding day creation - I tried to make this one a little more specific of an opportunity or business idea yet AI surprised me again. It gave 18 specific points, some the same as the last search. 


tiktok ideas for wedding photographers to grow tiktok following - The more specific I try to get, the more information it gives. This time 18 bullet points outlining different content ideas to post. One idea/opportunity it gave was telling a story time over photos. Like telling the story of the wedding day while showing a slideshow of the wedding photos. These ideas it gave are great ideas. That is probably one I would use and try. ",,,,,,,,"Great observation regarding the specificity of the prompts needed. Ultimately what makes a ""good"" opportunity is one that you will take action on.",,,
MS,1,Fall,AI,3,"1. My first prompt was possible business opportunities to increase the number of 
disabled parking spaces. Accessible Parking Reservation System: Develop a 
reservation system specifically for accessible parking spaces, allowing users to book 
spots in advance and pay for their use. This could be used for events, venues, and 
popular destinations. Parking Space Design and Consultation Services: Start a business
that specializes in designing accessible parking spaces for various types of locations. 
Offer consultations to property owners, businesses, and municipalities to help them 
optimize their parking lots for accessibility and compliance with disability regulations. 
Parking Space Monitoring and Enforcement: Develop technology solutions to monitor 
parking spaces and enforce accessibility regulations. For example, smart cameras and 
sensors that identify parking violations in real-time. I feel like all of these opportunities 
could be rather useful. An accessible parking reservation system would be nice so there 
are no worries upon arrival. 
2. My second prompt was how do I keep my sponge from producing unpleasant odors? 
Use a Sponge Holder: Invest in a sponge holder or caddy that keeps the sponge 
elevated and allows air to circulate around it. This can help prevent the growth of 
bacteria and mold. Air Dry: Allow the sponge to air dry completely between uses. Ensure
it's placed in a well-ventilated area, preferably one with direct sunlight, as sunlight has 
natural antibacterial properties. From these responses I have concluded it would be in 
my best interest to buy a sponge holder. Sponge holders already exist so there would 
not be much potential opportunity. 
3. My third prompt was, how can I efficiently keep hair off of the bathroom floor? Use a 
Handheld Vacuum: Keep a handheld vacuum or a small, portable vacuum cleaner in the 
bathroom for quick and efficient hair cleanup. Hair Broom: Consider using a broom 
designed for pet hair, which is often more effective at collecting hair from floors. 
Encourage Good Habits: If you share the bathroom, remind others to be mindful of 
keeping hair off the floor and encourage them to adopt these practices. There is not 
much opportunity here for a potential business idea as I would just have to purchase 
something that already exists and remind my roommates to be more mindful. 
4. My fourth prompt was, how do I keep my windshield from fogging up. Use Anti-Fog 
Products: Apply an anti-fog treatment or product specifically designed for windshields 
and glass surfaces. These can help prevent fogging for an extended period. Even in cold
weather, using the air conditioning system helps remove moisture from the air, 
preventing condensation on the windshield. Make sure it's set to the fresh air mode, not 
recirculation. I feel like there could be potential business opportunities to create a new 
anti-fog product. 
5. My fifth prompt was, what are ways to prevent losing the charging cap to my apple 
pencil. Magnetic Attachments: Explore magnetic options like magnetic cases or sleeves 
for your iPad that can securely hold your Apple Pencil and its cap. Use Cap Keeper 
Apps: There are apps available that can help you locate your lost Apple Pencil cap by 
making it emit a sound or flashing a light. This can be useful if you misplace it. I would 
have to explore the options of the magnetic sleeves or cases because I feel like that 
would be most useful. 
From best to worst I would rank the prompts: 1, 5, 4, 3, 2 
I would be interested in increasing the number of disabled parking spaces via developing
an accessible parking reservation system that businesses could use to benefit disabled 
customers. Being able to park in any given space is something able bodied people like 
myself take for granted and can create frustration and anxiety for those who need 
disabled parking. Creating an app that allows people to reserve a spot will help give 
wheelchair users peace of mind that there will always be guaranteed parking upon 
arrival to their destination",,,,,,,,NIce work using prior problems as prompts. Great way to see that there are multiple ways of solving a problem.,,,
TS,0,Fall,AI,3,"Generate five entrepreneurship opportunities in today's world.

Chat GPT: 

1. Eco-Friendly Products and Services: With increasing environmental awareness, there's a growing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products and services. This can range from biodegradable packaging solutions, energy-efficient technologies, organic food products, and eco-friendly fashion.

2. Digital Health and Wellness: The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions. There are opportunities in telemedicine, mental health apps, wearable health tech, personalized nutrition, and virtual fitness coaching.

3. Remote Work Tools and Services: The shift towards remote work has created a demand for tools and services that facilitate efficient virtual collaboration, team management, cybersecurity, and digital communication platforms.

4. Education Technology (EdTech): The education sector is ripe for innovation, with opportunities in online learning platforms, personalized learning experiences, virtual classrooms, educational games, and tools for skill development and upskilling.

5. Aging Population Solutions: With an aging population in many parts of the world, there's a growing need for products and services that cater to the elderly. This includes healthcare solutions, assistive technologies, home modifications, and services for in-home care and companionship.


I would not want to pursue any of these five opportunities because they are not who I am. If I had to pick one, it would be the first one because I do think we could use more people in that field, as a socity we can alwyas do better at keeping the envirment healthy.",,,,,,,,Great work!

AT,1,Fall,AI,3,"The Prompt: Business solutions for unaffordable organic and healthier food options
The Opportunities (ranked in order from best to worst):
1. Community Gardens
a. Support or initiate community garden projects that allow individuals and families
to grow their organic produce.
i. 
*
2. Mobile Markets
a. Launch mobile markets or food trucks that sell organic and healthy foods in
underserved neighborhoods. This brings the food to where it's needed most and
can reduce infrastructure costs.
i. 
It was really hard for me to decide whether Community Gardens or
Mobile Markets should be ranked first. I think both opportunities are
spectacular and unique. Neither are opportunities I would have thought of
on my own. I think when it comes down to it, community gardens and
mobile markets are two things that should go hand in hand and both be
done simultaneously. Mobile markets are targeted at lower income groups
and underserved neighborhoods. I think this is a problem all on its own
that deserves a solution. I decided to rank this opportunity second solely
because it would reach a smaller portion of people. I think a business
could easily incorporate both ideas though, in order to reach all members
of the community. I love this idea for a business opportunity though
because it provides a solution to the lack of accessibility and high costs of
organic foods. This opportunity gives options and choices to people who
might not have ever had a choice.

3. Educational Programs
a. Offer workshops, classes, and resources on how to cook healthy meals on a
budget. Education can empower individuals to make better food choices and
stretch their dollars further.
i. 
In my opinion, education is one of the most important aspects of healthy
eating. Many people are not educated on the things that they are eating and
what they are actually consuming. Offering educational programs teaches
the community about these things which is information that is not
normally shared or taught. These programs would teach people why they
should eat organically. This opportunity ranks third though because I could
see only the most proactive of community members taking part. It is likely
to assume that a lot of people prefer to remain ignorant on these matters
because they believe it is âout of their control.â
4. Subscription Services
a. Develop a subscription-based service that delivers organic and healthy food
directly to customers' homes. By operating online and eliminating physical
storefronts, you can reduce overhead costs.
i. 
I think that this is a somewhat potential opportunity. It is a great idea and
could be a great business idea. However, what holds me back from this
idea, and resulted in its fourth place ranking, is the fact that there are
already businesses designed to do this. The idea itself is good and could be
beneficial. From an entrepreneurial standpoint, there would be some
already well established competitors that could make it difficult. It might
also be difficult to figure out a way of storing and shipping that keeps
produce in good condition.
5. Community Supported Agriculture
a. Create a CSA program that allows community members to purchase shares of a
local farm's produce. This can help farmers secure funds in advance and provide
fresh, organic food to shareholders at a lower cost.
i. 
I think this is a good idea, however probably the most difficult business
out of all five opportunities. It is highly likely that many people in the
community might not want to purchase shares of a local farmâs produce. It
might not be cost effective, depending on the details. Not only would
community members have to purchase shares, they would also have to
purchase organic foods. Even though the food would be offered to owners
of shares at a lower cost, I could see this being something difficult to
convince customers of. Although Iâm sure there are people who would
love this opportunity, I think it is rather niche. The idea is to make it easier

for people to have access to organic foods, not make it more expensive.
Only people truly interested would take part in this program. From a
business standpoint, it would most likely take a longer period of time to
receive a payout.
*I would be somewhat interested in pursuing all of these opportunities to an extent. In my
opinion, these were the best opportunities that were generated from my prompt; although some
of these ideas are better than others. However, I would be most interested in pursuing
opportunities 1-3. I thought that the idea of a community garden was very smart and had a lot of
advantages. I had never heard of a community garden, or anything like it, which makes it the
smartest business venture, in my opinion. There cannot be many community gardens so there
would not be much competition. I think people would be driven to a community garden too
because it is most cost effective for them. People who partake in a community garden can trust
the process 100% since they would be doing it themselves, and it could even be an enjoyable
hobby. In a way, it reminds me of a couple of pottery painting studios that Iâve been to. Pottery
painting studios can be found pretty much anywhere and they are always bustling with people.
The idea is that consumers pay a fee to use the space and materials to create something of their
own and then they have access to everything that the studio has, without having to go buy their
own. I think that a community garden staged in this fashion would be very popular and a great
asset to the community, as well as a good business venture.",,,,,,,,"Nice work!

MW,1,Fall,AI,3,"Question/Opportunity 1:

My student academic senate position involves me carrying around a microphone every two weeks for faculty to speak at meetings. Besides this part of the job, I work in the academic office and I file syllabus into the master course syllabus system so the university can eventually get rid of hard copies of syllabus. When I went to carry the microphone last week I dressed in professional clothes that were Halloween themed. What opportunity could come out of dressing up like this at a serious event?

Chat GPT's Response:

Dressing in Halloween-themed professional attire at a serious academic event like the student academic senate meeting where you're responsible for carrying a microphone can be both fun and memorable. While it's important to maintain professionalism in your role, there could be some opportunities and benefits to consider:

Engaging and Lightening the Atmosphere: Dressing up can add an element of fun and entertainment to what might otherwise be a routine or mundane meeting. It can help break the ice and create a more relaxed atmosphere, encouraging participation and interaction among attendees.


Networking and Socializing: Your attire can be a conversation starter. People may approach you to discuss your costume, which can provide an opportunity to network and build connections with faculty, staff, or fellow students you might not have interacted with otherwise.


Showcasing Creativity: A Halloween-themed outfit can showcase your creativity and personality. It can be a way for others to see your approachable and approachable side, which can lead to more positive interactions.


Creating a Memorable Impression: People tend to remember distinctive individuals or moments. Your costume can make you memorable, and this could be an advantage when you interact with faculty or colleagues in your academic office work or future endeavors.


Promoting Team Spirit: If your attire aligns with the theme of the event and others also dress up, it can foster a sense of camaraderie and unity among attendees.


Breaking the Ice: Sometimes, serious academic meetings can be intimidating, especially for new or shy individuals. Your costume can serve as a conversation starter and help ease people into the proceedings.


Promoting Positive Vibes: In academic settings, where stress and tension can sometimes run high, a light-hearted costume can help improve the overall mood and energy of the meeting.


While there are potential benefits to dressing up in a Halloween-themed outfit, it's essential to gauge the formality and culture of your academic institution and the specific meeting. Ensure that your attire is not disruptive or disrespectful, and be mindful of the balance between fun and professionalism. If it aligns with the culture of your academic community and doesn't detract from the meeting's purpose, it can be a creative way to make your role more enjoyable and memorable.

Assesment of Potential Opportunities: It looks like being creative and fun with my outfits at work can possibly lighten the mood, break the ice, and help me network with the higher status people around me. This could lead to new work relationships and job opportunities as well. I guess this makes me think about how people want people who work with them to be complex in depth people with good ideas and not just work zombies.


Question/Opportunity 2:

When I work in Academic Senate meetings I have to make sure that I keep a straight face when carrying around the microphone for faculty. Most of the time, faculty can feel very upset or passionate about certain topics brought up during the meetings. I often feel most of the energy from these emotions in the room and it can be overwhelming. Especially when a faculty member yelled about a subject when I was standing right next to them. Oftentimes after meetings I feel burnt out and exhausted because of things like this. However, I want to look on the bright side with this situation. What opportunities can come from this emotional and energetic awareness?

Chat GPT's Response:

Your ability to maintain a straight face and stay composed while dealing with emotionally charged situations during Academic Senate meetings is a valuable skill. While it can be emotionally taxing, there are several opportunities and benefits that can arise from your emotional and energetic awareness in this role:

Conflict Resolution Skills: Over time, you can develop strong conflict resolution skills by observing how faculty members express their emotions during meetings. This can be a valuable skill in various professional settings, including mediation and negotiation roles.


Empathy and Understanding: Your heightened emotional awareness can help you empathize with the concerns and perspectives of faculty members. This can be beneficial in building rapport and trust with them, enhancing your ability to work collaboratively.


Networking Opportunities: Your role allows you to interact with faculty members on a regular basis. Building positive relationships with them can lead to networking opportunities and connections within the academic community, which can be valuable for your future career.


Emotional Intelligence Development: Dealing with emotional situations can help you further develop your emotional intelligence, a critical skill in many professions. This self-awareness and ability to manage emotions are highly valued in leadership and teamwork.


Conflict Management Training: If your university offers training or workshops in conflict management and emotional intelligence, taking advantage of these opportunities can help you further develop these skills.


Leadership Opportunities: As you gain experience and demonstrate your ability to handle emotionally charged situations professionally, you may be recognized as a valuable team member and considered for leadership roles within the Academic Senate or other organizations.


Stress Management and Resilience: Dealing with intense emotions can help you develop stress management techniques and resilience. These skills can be beneficial in maintaining your own well-being in high-pressure situations.


Understanding Organizational Dynamics: Observing the emotional dynamics within academic meetings can provide you with a deeper understanding of the inner workings and politics of your academic institution, which can be useful in navigating the academic landscape.


Public Speaking and Presentation Skills: Your role may require you to speak in front of a group. This can improve your public speaking and presentation skills, which are valuable in a wide range of careers.


Self-Awareness: Through your experiences, you can develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-regulation, which are crucial for personal and professional growth.


It's important to remember that while these opportunities can arise from your emotional and energetic awareness, it's also vital to prioritize your own mental and emotional well-being. If you find the emotional toll of your role overwhelming, consider seeking support or guidance to help you manage the challenges effectively and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Your ability to remain composed in emotionally charged situations is a valuable asset, and with the right approach, you can use it to your advantage both personally and professionally.

Assesment of Potential Opportunities: I didn't realize how this job could be building my backbone and teaching me emotional awareness. Whatever I go into, I can use these skills to be aware of the work environment around me and make people feel heard while hopefully learning how to handle these emotionally and energetically draining environments better.


Question/Opportunity 3:

While I realize that physical and mental health should be taken care of first, I am a big pursuer of spiritual health and personally believe it is eye opening and life changing. So much so that I believe it should be balanced with the other two types of health previously stated. I am also a tarot reader and emotional energy and mind's eye channel. When I give people readings I make sure that learning about their mental and physical health is mixed in with learning about their spiritual health and would NEVER recommend spiritual health over the other two. I have 5 years of experience in tarot and 1 year of experience in channeling. What is an opportunity that lies with these abilities?

Chat GPT's Response:

Your unique combination of skills as a tarot reader and emotional energy channel offers various opportunities for personal and professional growth. While it's essential to prioritize physical and mental health, many people find value in exploring their spiritual well-being, and you can play a significant role in helping them. Here are some opportunities that can arise from your abilities:

Holistic Well-being Services: You can offer holistic well-being services that encompass physical, mental, and spiritual health. This can include providing guidance and insights using tarot readings and emotional energy channeling to help individuals gain a more comprehensive understanding of themselves.


Personal Development and Coaching: Use your skills to offer personal development and coaching services that help individuals work on their self-awareness, goal setting, and life purpose. This can be a valuable resource for those looking to achieve balance and fulfillment in their lives.


Workshops and Seminars: Host workshops or seminars on topics related to spirituality, self-discovery, and emotional healing. These events can help individuals explore their spiritual path while also addressing their mental and physical well-being.


Writing and Blogging: Share your insights and knowledge through writing, whether it's a blog, articles, or books. This can help reach a broader audience and provide valuable information to those seeking guidance in these areas.


Online Presence: Establish an online presence through social media, a website, or a YouTube channel where you share regular guidance, tarot readings, and channeling sessions.

Question/Opportunity 5:

The past two years I was a part of an a cappella group. I recently quit because I felt they were treating me unfair and holding me to unfair standards. Looking at past situations I can also tell that they socially bullied me as well. I initially didn't want to say anything to anyone about my experience because I wanted to leave quietly and not stir up a fuss, but I realized that if I didn't speak up that other people could join the group and get treated the same way. I went to the advisor for the group after I quit and reported my experiences. I expressed that I didn't want to take down the group, but that I feel their unfair structure and how they handle social situations in the group need to change. What opportunities can stem from me coming to the advisor with this information?

Chat GPT's Response:

Reporting your experiences and concerns to the advisor of your a cappella group is a courageous and proactive step to address issues within the group. While your intention is not to take down the group but to foster positive change, there are several opportunities and potential outcomes that can arise from your decision to speak up:

Improved Group Dynamics: Your feedback can lead to a better understanding of the issues within the group and prompt changes in the way social interactions and dynamics are handled. This can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for current and future members.


Support for Others: By speaking up, you are advocating for a safer and more welcoming space for future members. Your actions can prevent others from going through similar negative experiences.


Conflict Resolution: Addressing the issues within the group can help facilitate a process of conflict resolution and reconciliation. This may involve open discussions, mediation, or other interventions aimed at resolving the underlying problems.


Educational Opportunities: Your report can lead to educational opportunities for the group, such as workshops or training on topics like team dynamics, communication, and conflict resolution.


Reform and Change: Your concerns may lead to structural changes within the group, such as revising rules, codes of conduct, and policies to ensure a fair and inclusive environment.


Advisor Involvement: The advisor can play a crucial role in mediating and facilitating conversations between you and the group members, helping to address the issues and work toward solutions.


Personal Growth: Speaking up about your experiences can be a significant personal growth opportunity. It demonstrates your willingness to advocate for yourself and others, even in challenging situations.


Mental Health and Well-being: Addressing the issues within the group can contribute to your own mental health and well-being by providing closure and resolution to your negative experiences.


Leadership Development: Your proactive approach in addressing these issues demonstrates leadership qualities and the ability to affect positive change within a group or organization.


Community Building: If changes are implemented, the group may become more united and collaborative, fostering a sense of community among its members.


Awareness and Accountability: Your report can raise awareness of the importance of fairness, inclusion, and accountability in student organizations. It may encourage other groups to assess their own structures and behaviors.


Conflict Resolution Skills: The process of addressing the issues can enhance your own conflict resolution and communication skills, which are valuable in both personal and professional settings.


Remember that while your goal is to prompt positive change, the response to your report may vary. It's important to approach this process with patience, empathy, and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue. Continue to advocate for what you believe is fair and just while also seeking a resolution that benefits all parties involved. Your actions can have a lasting impact on the a cappella group and the individuals within it.


Assesment of Potential Opportunities: If I apply these opportunites to entrpreneurial ventures in the future, whatever I do, I can make people feel heard and resolve social conflict efficiently.

Final Overview:

Opportunity 1: RANK 5 - While dressing up in a fun, expressive way could lead to networking, promoting a positive atmosphere, and breaking the ice, it is the least likely to lead to an entrepreneurial opportunity.

Opportunity 2: RANK 4 - Knowing how to read a room, in my opinion, can get people into opportunites with work environments that require a lot of empathy, but that alone doesn't gaureentee a job.

Opportunity 3: RANK 1 - My spiritual practice with a big focus on mental health and physical health could lead me to providing services for people as a business. There's a big market for tarot entrpreneurs right now. I can help people and myself AND make a profit.

Opportunity 4: RANK 2 - Publishing my own content is in second because I'm not as confident in posting work that I hold so close to my chest. If I open up I could share my vision and possibly make a career out of it.

Opportunity 5: RANK 3 - By being able to call people out in a professional mannor is essential in the workplace. With my new ability to do this, if I encounter similar behavior to what I experienced in the a cappella group, I can discourage and build from that behavior in entrepreneurial settings.

BW,1,Fall,AI,3,"I asked ChatGPT: ""find opportunities that help create ways to keep wine cool for long periods of time on the go""

This is what it said. 

Portable Wine Coolers: Design compact, high-efficiency wine coolers that are easy to carry and can maintain the wine's temperature for extended periods. Consider incorporating technologies like thermoelectric cooling or vacuum insulation to improve cooling performance.

Wine Cooler Bags: Develop stylish, insulated wine cooler bags with multiple compartments for wine bottles and wine glasses. These could be popular for picnics, outdoor events, and travel.

Smart Wine Coolers: Create smart wine coolers that are connected to mobile apps, allowing users to monitor and control the temperature remotely. This technology can be valuable for wine enthusiasts and wine storage during transportation.

Solar-Powered Wine Coolers: Design wine coolers with built-in solar panels that can charge the cooling system during the day, making them sustainable and suitable for outdoor

These are the most relevant options generated and I would rank these a follows: Solar-Powered Cooler, Portable Cooler, Smart Cooler, and Wine Cooler Bag. I would mostly likely prefer to mesh the Solar-Powered and portable coolers together because it encapsulates the product I had in mind in when thinking of products to help my problem and it addresses the frustrations I had during the event.

HM,1,Spring,Observation,4,"Accident Prevention: Sand or Salt? In winter, either sand or salt is added to the snowy/icy
roads for vehicle accident prevention. Whatâs the difference? Sand does not clear away 
snow and ice like salt does. However, sand does provide traction to the road and does not 
freeze at any temperature. Salt melts away the ice due to its ability to lower the freezing 
temperature capacity. However, the temperature is limited to a low of 12 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Salt also deteriorates steel â so, your vehicle. It also alters the environmentâs 
ânormalâ conditions. Sand may provide traction, but it also adds a build-up of unnecessary
material. The state of Michigan uses salt on the roads where other states, such as Montana
or Colorado, use a sand and salt mixture. You can agree that these states have steep 
mountains and hilly landscapes so this mixture must work pretty well when attempting to 
prevent accidents. I believe that Michigan needs to start using this mixture. Salt is a very 
cheap substance, but we also have natural sand deposits. If Michigan were to use this 
mixture, the residents of the state would be able to drive safer and the road commission 
wouldnât have to be on the roads 24/7. Vehicles would be less deteriorated by the salt as 
well. Due to the cheapness of the salt and our natural sand deposits, this could possibly be
an even cheaper solution to the one being used currently.

AT,1,Fall,Observation,4,"Lack of efficient parking spaces; having to pay for a parking spot both in public and at
housing establishments
a. This is a personal problem that my husband and I face pretty much everyday in
San Diego. Our apartment complex charges $60/month to reserve a tiny parking
space, or thereâs first come first serve parking spots. We drive an SUV so it is
very difficult to find parking spaces that our car will fit into with space to open
the doors. Last night we went out for dinner with friends and came home late,
around 9 PM. This is when all of the parking spaces near our unit are usually full
so we had to park all the way down by the leasing office and walk. This morning
we were leaving to get Starbucks and someone had parked so close to our car on
the passenger side that my husband had to pull out of the spot before I could open
the door and get in. This problem gets very frustrating because I donât like
walking far in the dark after I get home. Itâs pretty inconvenient. A lot of the time
we take our dogs in the car too so itâs pretty much impossible to open the doors to
let the dogs in if one of us is by ourselves and cannot pull out of the parking spot
first. Mostly it is just irritating and frustrating for us residents, but Iâd say Iâm
pretty used to it and have learned to accept it. We are usually at home and settled
before everyone else gets home and the parking spaces become full. I think those
emotions are the reason why many people pay $60/month to pay for a reserved
parking spot. We have thought about doing it as well but have always decided
against it since the reserved spots are often the smallest, and I personally hate

BG,1,Spring,Observation,5," In line with that, as I went down to my car I realized I did not have an ice scraper/ snow brush. I had not put it back in my car after the summer from the garage. Such a simple tool that makes life so much easier when you live in colder climates. When the ice freezes on your windshield, when you do not have an ice scraper, you have one of two options: you have to wait for your car to heat up and blast the heat on your windshield until it is melted enough to safely drive, or you can ruin your windshield wipers and use those to scrape the ice off your windshield. The price ranges from $5 to upwards of $30 with additional attachments. Mostly it is just plastic, creating a high profti margin for producers.

With inclimate weather, it increases. An addition to the app informing drivers where the roads have been plowed or salted would benefit consumers greatly.

HM,1,Spring,Observation,5,"College Edition: Automated Artificial Plant Light. Surprisingly, most college students 
own plants â and never just one. Having ownership and the responsibility to keep 
something simple alive may provide a student with a sense of stability during these crazy 
undergraduate years. A plant requires some necessities to survive. Nutrient rich soil, 
sufficient water supply, and sunlight are what allow a plant to survive and thrive in any 
environment. Only two of these three necessities are in reach â sunlight is not one of 
them. Most automated lights are very expensive and difficult to set up. A college student 
is defined as broke and probably likes something that wonât waste their time. Therefore, a
college student friendly cost and an easy set-up is ideal. Dorms only have one window 
with a not so great, for plants, windowsill. Plus, the curtain is closed the majority of the 
time. A cheap plant light that can be easily programmed for certain times of the day. This 
would most likely be purchased very quickly.",,,,,,,,"Cool solutions.

So many of us deal with joint muscle or bone pain and dont really have a real way to make it better. The best remededies for these things are usually Heat, Ice, Or compression.

Good Experience #1
After practicing this morning, I decided to take some more time to make a good 
breakfast. Normally I scramble some eggs and call it good, but today I wanted to spice it up. I 
took the time to sear some steak, toast some bread, sautÃ© onions, and make some sunny-side-
up eggs. I made a delicious breakfast sandwich that satisfied my hunger. Taking some more time
to make something pays off. I was so impressed with it that I took a picture.â",,,,,,,,Great job focusing on things that are relevant to your life.

One of my teammates, Simon, tore his ACL and has been sitting out of practice for the 
past few weeks. Whenever he is at practice, he always has to put two foam rollers underneath 
his knee so he can sit comfortably on the mats. I can tell he is still uncountable because I 
straight-up ask him. Today I asked him while laughing, âAre you comfortable Simon?â and his 
response was a no. Simon is a bigger guy, granted he's one of our heavyweights, so I think he 
needs a different solution for something to rest his leg on. ",,,,,,,,Great job focusing on things that are relevant to your life.

Despite my egg and steak sandwich. I am currently cutting weight for our team wrestle-
offs tomorrow. Breakfast wasnât a lot, but it was delicious. After eating I still had more weight to 
lose. At this point in the week, most of the weight lost is water weight. Losing water weight 
means you get thirsty. I've always wished that there was some way to drink a liquid that would 
quench thirst but wouldnât add weight to you. I'm not sure how realistic that would be but itâs a

Today, I had a voice memo sent to me from another photographer asking about a project that I am working on and how she could possibly be involved. She started out the voice memo extremely peppy and upbeat. Her voice was higher pitched and seemed to carry and be louder. Once she started talking about a negative experience she had with another photographer, her voice changed and it almost dropped an octave and she became quieter. There was less excitement and fluctuation between her tone. When she was excited, you could hear it in her voice, when she talked about the negative experience her voice and mood became almost somber.

AT,1,Fall,Observation,5,"Feeling stressed or overwhelmed after a busy day
a. This is something we can all relate to in our own sense. Personally, I am always
stressed and it is very easy for me to feel overwhelmed. For me, they are
definitely intense emotions. Some days are worse than others and Iâm sure most
people can relate. Depending on a personâs life and situations, it is possible to feel
stressed/overwhelmed every day, or just after a particularly busy day too. The last
few weeks have been a particularly stressful time for my husband and I as we will
have to move soon. I am also going to school full time, and our puppy has been
sick. I think that people would be driven to buy something to fix this problem but
I think the market is saturated with products aimed towards that problem. Maybe
if the product or service were unique enough and had scientific evidence to back it
up, people would be more prone to try it and make a purchase. I think that I would
buy something to fix this problem for myself.",,,,,,,,"Great job reflecting on the emotional aspects of the problems. Here's some specific feedback on each one to help you refine your abilities moving forward.

1. Overwhelmed is a strong emotion but as you pointed out it is usually because of alll the things (Sorry to hear about the sick Puppy). In order to make this actionable you'd either have to drill down on a specific stressor that contributes to help prevent but more than likely you'll need to think about recovery. Think about commercials for bubblebath or vacations, they usually play off of the hectic overwhelmed feeling but focus on either relaxing or having fun. So as you observe negative emotions think about what people want to feel instead.

2. This is one of those where you have to dig deeper and think about the root cause or the other side of the experience. What causes traffic and who can do something about it? Remember a ""good"" opportunity is one you personally can do something to fix. Roads/infrastructure are usually not something you can fix on your own.The next thing you need to consider is what would make it worth it to the business or government to buy a solution that could be implemented that fixes the problem. In many cases businesses don't want to spend more money if it doesn't bring them more money. For government, they have to beable to show their voters that they are using money wisely and can fix things complained about-if no one complains probably not worth the paperwork to fix. Think win-win-win.

3. Great job here recognizing that a solution might be difficult because it involves controlling others in your case. You might want to dig deeper to explore why your husband tends to be late.

4. Nice work! Some ideas have a limited market size which is part of your evaluation criteria

5. Niche problems can be great if there is enough people with a common experience. The citizenship process is fraught with ineffeciencies and expensive solutions. The use of technology can often lower expensive solutions. Legal AI might be able to reduce the billable time required.

AT,1,Fall,Observation,5,"Getting stuck in traffic on your way home from work
a. This problem probably depends mostly on where a person is located but I think
traffic is a problem everywhere at least some of the time. Here in San Diego, if
you drive north anywhere from 7-10 AM, you hit traffic. The same is true if you
are driving south anywhere from 3-7 PM. It is incredibly annoying and
frustrating, especially after a long day of work when you just want to get home. I
often face this traffic on my way home from work in the afternoon/early evening.
We also always have to plan ahead if we decide to do something in the afternoon
so we can avoid traffic on the way home. We live in the most southern part of San
Diego, California, right by the border to Mexico. That being said, anywhere we
go is north of us and we always have the chance of hitting traffic on the way home
if we donât time it accordingly. If people commute to work then this is a problem
they face every single day of the week. Luckily, I am usually exposed to traffic
coming home from work a couple of days a week. I think pretty much everyone,
myself included, would purchase a product or service that is aimed at eliminating

this problem. It is very inconvenient to be stuck in traffic, and oftentimes more
accidents are caused as a result making it dangerous as well.",,,,,,,,"Great job reflecting on the emotional aspects of the problems. Here's some specific feedback on each one to help you refine your abilities moving forward.

An automated laundry hamper could utilize RFID tags or color-coding on clothing items. Equipped with sensors, it sorts clothes as they are tossed in, recognizing the tags or colors and categorizing them accordingly. This technology, combined with a programmable sorting system inside the hamper, ensures an effortless and efficient way to organize laundry.
",,,,,,,,Next time don't forget to assess the output-your practicing evaluation during these ChatGPT assignments,,,
HM,1,Spring,AI,6,"1. âPlastic Binders Break Constantly, Get A Heavy Duty Oneâ. Have you ever heard of a 
âheavy-dutyâ binder? Probably not, just the oneâs that can supposedly hold more. I have 
always had the issue of the bindings breaking on my binders as well as the inside folders. 
ChatGPT gives an option to buy industrial-grade binders that are made to âwithstand 
frequent use and heavy loadsâ. Following this, a list of features for a well-designed 
heavy-duty binder. A few brands that sell these are mentioned at the bottom. However, I 
have never seen school-appropriate binders. I do not, and Iâm assuming that other 
students of any education, want an industrial looking binder. I want pretty colors, designs,
etc. These binders need to be appealing. ChatGPT does not cover this appeal or mention 
it. The potential for this product is good, but itâs not great. As mentioned, appeal is a large
part of product sale. I would pursue this product, but I would make the necessary 
adaptions for better product sale. 
2. âMini Mops for College Dorm Roomsâ. Dorms are compact rooms that make living a 
little less enjoyable sometimes. Not only is the space small, but you have to deal with the 
fact that someone else slept in your bed, used this desk, this chair, this dresser, and God 
knows what happened to the floor and walls. The floors are exceptionally disgusting. A 
mini compact mop would do the trick. Something thatâs easy to store and easy to use. 
ChatGPT agrees with the easy-to-store and compact point. However, ChatGPT does not 
provide anything else other than name brand mops. I was unaware that mops were made 
mini. The mops listed are hand-held mops (as in less than a foot long) and brooms with 
dustpans. Or they are a general size mop with a bucket attachment. This is overall not 
helpful because the floor needs to be cleaned very well and must have the ability to be 
compact. Therefore, I would not pursue ChatGPTâs idea of a mini mop. 
3. âSpecific Fridge-Top Storageâ. Do you have too many plastic containers, water bottles, 
and generally just eye sores? Is the only place to put them is in your cupboards where 
theyâll just fall right back into your face every time you open them? Well, if each fridge 
came with a specialized storage compartment, like a matching box or such, then storage 
would be much easier in your home. ChatGPT provides a list of multiple products rather 
than a specific specialized one. When buying a fridge, you wonder whatâs going to be 
placed on top of it because thatâs empty space you donât want to waste. The solution is 
for the fridge companies to specifically make storage bins for the top of your fridge. They
should be customizable to your liking as well. ChatGPT did not give a good 
representation of this. I would not pursue ChatGPTâs version. 
4. âDe-shedding Shampoo for Dogsâ. Do you have a furry dog that leaves its hair 
everywhere? Do you wish you could just bathe it and have it not shed for a time? 
Although there are multiple products out there, are they really that efficient when it 
comes to de-shedding a pet? ChatGPT gives a list of de-shedding shampoo for dogs. Each
product listed includes ingredients that are supposed to help de-shed your dog after a 
bath. ChatGPT also provides some advice, âconsider factors such as your dogâs skin type 
and any existing condition before choosing a de-shedding shampooâ. As well as 
consistent grooming advice. All of these will help when tackling a shedding dog. 

Although each of these products may help, a scientifically proven de-shedding shampoo 
would benefit many people â especially those allergic to shedding dogs. ChatGPT didnât 
provide a potential opportunity. Therefore, this is not worth pursuing. 
5. âA Medication to Decrease the Drool & Slobber from Dogsâ. Do you hate when a 
slobbery dog comes and ruins your clothes? A medication that could decrease the amount 
of excess saliva a dog creates would work wonders. Some people are unprepared to own 
a drooly dog and are unwilling to deal with it. Excess drool can cause more grooming 
appointments which are expensive. Each dog is worthy of love no matter how drooly they
are. ChatGPT focuses on health practices to manage excessive salivation. Along with 
âanti-slobberâ products which are specialized products to absorb and control drool. 
However, these are not a medical innovation to decrease the amount of dog slobber. A 
potential opportunity was not provided by ChatGPT. Therefore, I would not be interested 
in pursuing this description rather than a real product.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
AM,0,Spring,AI,6,"I would like for you to make another brief list of five different everyday examples of inconveniences or problems that the average working class person faces, and a possible invention or solution to help prevent or lessen the listed issues. I would like for specific, but still widely common examples.
ChatGPT's Response
Commute Delays:
Problem: Daily commute can be unpredictable due to traffic, public transportation delays, or other unforeseen issues.
Solution: A smart transportation app that uses real-time data to suggest alternative routes, modes of transportation, or optimal departure times to minimize delays.
Meal Planning Stress:

Problem: Busy individuals often struggle with planning and preparing meals, leading to unhealthy eating habits.
Solution: A meal planning app that considers dietary preferences, schedules, and nutritional needs, providing personalized weekly meal plans with easy-to-follow recipes and grocery lists.
Work-Life Balance:

Problem: Balancing work and personal life is challenging, leading to stress and burnout.
Solution: A productivity tool that helps individuals prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and allocate time efficiently, promoting a healthier work-life balance.
Healthcare Appointment Hassles:

Problem: Booking, rescheduling, or managing healthcare appointments can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Solution: An integrated healthcare app that streamlines appointment scheduling, sends reminders, and allows easy communication with healthcare providers, reducing administrative burdens.
Financial Budgeting Difficulty:

Problem: Many struggle with budgeting and managing finances effectively.
Solution: A comprehensive financial management app that tracks income, expenses, and savings goals, providing personalized insights and suggestions to help individuals make informed financial decisions.
These are all very smart responses, even if they may not be the most original. As ChatGPT is trained on existing knowledge and information, it makes sense that many of the business 'opportunities' generated by the program may already have solutions, or even entire businesses centered around them. One response I personally took interest in was the proposal of a meal-planning app. As someone who lives alone and has to prepare all food for myself, it can be hard to stay on top of my needs and personal dietary goals. Having an app that can catagorize most or all of my dietary needs into meals and foods that I enjoy would be incredibly helpful in my day-to-day life. ",,,,,,,,Nice job noticing what opportunities appealed to you. That is ultimately what you want to get good at is finding opportunities you'd be interested and able to pursue.,,,
LM,1,Spring,AI,6,"The prompt I used in ChatGPT was, what are 5 opportunities that entrepreneurs might see 
and whether the opportunity would be worth solving or not and why?
Ranking Best to Worst:
1. Emerging Technology Trends:
a. Opportunity: Entrepreneurs might identify a new and growing technology trend, 
such as artificial intelligence or blockchain, as an opportunity to create innovative 
products or services.
b. Worth Solving: Yes, if the entrepreneur has the expertise and resources to 
capitalize on the trend. However, it's essential to evaluate market saturation and 
potential longevity of the trend.
2. Ethical AI Consulting Services:
a. Opportunity: Entrepreneurs can establish consulting firms specializing in ethical 
AI. As AI technologies advance, there is a growing need for businesses to 
navigate ethical considerations such as bias, transparency, and accountability in 
their AI systems.
b. Worth Solving: Yes, as companies increasingly adopt AI, ethical concerns become 
paramount. Offering guidance on ethical AI practices can help businesses build 
trust with customers and avoid potential legal and reputational risks.
3. Education Technology for Underprivileged Communities:
a. Opportunity: Entrepreneurs can develop educational technology solutions tailored 
for underprivileged communities, ensuring equal access to quality education. 

b. Worth Solving: Bridging educational gaps contributes to social equity. 
Entrepreneurs tackling this issue not only create a business opportunity but also 
contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty through education.
4. Ethical Sourcing and Supply Chain Transparency:
a. Opportunity: Entrepreneurs can address the increasing demand for ethically 
sourced products by creating platforms that provide transparency in the supply 
chain. This involves ensuring fair labor practices, environmentally friendly 
production, and fair trade. 
b. Worth Solving: Yes, this issue aligns with the growing consumer preference for 
ethical consumption, making it a worthwhile opportunity.
5. Community Building Initiatives:
a. Opportunity: Entrepreneurs may focus on building communities around shared 
interests or causes. This could involve creating physical spaces for communal 
activities, organizing events, or developing platforms that connect like-minded 
individuals.
b. Worth Solving: In an increasingly digital world, there is a yearning for genuine 
connections. Entrepreneurs addressing the need for community building 
contribute to social cohesion and provide people with a sense of belonging, 
making it a valuable opportunity.
I believe that all the opportunities provided by ChatGPT have potential; however, the only one 
that would be worth pursuing is opportunity 2 because with the new advancement in AI it might 
become more of an ethics problem than a labor problem.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,6,"1. Prompt: ""Identify underserved needs in sustainable fashion.""
Challenges or gaps in sustainable fashion, such as limited accessibility, high prices, or 
lack of stylish options.
The potential relates to the increasing need for environmentally conscious clothing that is
connected to careful purchasing. The market is growing as more consumers look for 
environmentally friendly options. Brands that specialize in sustainable fashion may be 
competitors. The answer can be developing a brand of trendy and reasonably priced 
sustainable clothing or a website that links customers to eco-friendly clothing retailers. 
Revenue models may involve goods sales or subscription services.
2. Prompt: ""Explore unmet needs in mental wellness for college students.""
challenges specific to the mental well-being of college students, such as academic stress, 
loneliness, or access barriers to mental health resources.
An everyday, emotional encounter that college students have. Considering the growing 
awareness of mental health on campuses, the market size is significant. Mental health 
applications and counseling services offered by universities could be competitors. A 
specific mental health app designed with college students in mind that provides 
information, support groups, or counseling services could be the answer. 
3. Prompt: ""Investigate problems with traditional job search platforms.""
Frustrations related to job search platforms, such as irrelevant job recommendations, lack 
of transparency, or difficulties in networking. 
This is a chance for job seekers who have strong emotional attachments to their work 
goals. The market is large because looking for a job is an everyday activity. Current job 
platforms are competitors. A more individualized job-matching algorithm, open employer
reviews, or cutting-edge networking tools could be the answer. Recruitment partnerships, 
premium subscriptions, and job posting fees are a few examples of revenue models.
4. Prompt: ""Explore challenges in sustainable living for urban dwellers.""

Insights into obstacles faced by urban residents in adopting sustainable living practices, 
such as limited green spaces, waste management issues, or high costs of eco-friendly 
products.
This is an opportunity to address a frequent experience for urban residents who have 
strong emotional connections to environmental issues. In cities where sustainability is 
becoming more and more important, the market size is substantial. Local eco-friendly 
projects could be rivals. The creation of eco-friendly items at reasonable prices, urban 
sustainability initiatives, or a platform that links locals with sustainable services could all 
be part of the solution. Product sales, subscription services, and joint ventures with 
nearby companies are examples of revenue models.
5. Prompt: ""Identify unmet needs in personalized online learning for professionals.""
challenges faced by professionals in online learning, such as lack of personalized content,
difficulty in balancing work and learning, or limited networking opportunities.
This tackles a typical problem faced by professionals who have strong emotional 
attachments to their careers and are looking for continuing education. The market is 
large because professionals place a high value on lifelong learning. Potential rivals could 
be already-existing virtual education systems. A platform that provides customized 
instruction, flexible scheduling, or professional networking opportunities might be the 
answer. Course fees, subscription services, and corporate collaborations are a few 
examples of revenue models.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
KS,1,Spring,AI,6,"Prompt: Give me 5 business opportunities
AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platforms:
Opportunity: Education is evolving towards personalized learning experiences, and there's a demand for 
platforms that leverage artificial intelligence to tailor educational content to individual needs.
Business Idea: Create an educational technology company that utilizes AI algorithms to analyze and 
understand learners' preferences, adapting the content delivery, assessments, and feedback in real time. 
This could cater to students of all ages, from K-12 to professional development.
My assessment: The idea behind this is strong since AI is becoming a prominent part of the internet at a 
fast pace. Although, I think where the idea fell flat is when it comes to education. Using AI is heavily 
frowned upon in education so maybe using AI to generate a learning platform would be contradictory. 
Local Food Distribution Networks:
Opportunity: Consumers are increasingly interested in supporting local businesses and accessing fresh, 
locally sourced food.
Business Idea: Establish a platform that connects local farmers, producers, and artisans with consumers. 
This could involve creating an online marketplace for locally-produced goods, as well as implementing 
efficient logistics for the timely and sustainable delivery of fresh products.
My assessment: This is a great business opportunity because it connects a community and supports small 
and local farmers, local businesses, and markets. Creating a place that can connect all these people will 
cause the local economy to boost. This would also open many more business opportunities for others. 
Digital Mental Health Support:
Opportunity: Mental health awareness is on the rise, and there's a need for accessible and stigma-free 
support services.
Business Idea: Establish a digital mental health platform that offers a range of services, including virtual 
counseling, mindfulness exercises, and mental health resources. This platform could leverage AI to 
provide personalized mental health recommendations based on user interactions and preferences.
My assessment: This is a good business opportunity because mental health is a thing that is being more 
talked about in society and being more normalized. Although I think this has been done before and to gain
enough loyal customers to have a stable business something innovative that hasnât been done before. I do 
think the AI aspect is a good addition that would bring in new customers as AI is relatively new and has 
not been used in digital mental health support to its full extent. 
Virtual Interior Design Services:
Opportunity: With an increasing focus on home aesthetics, there's a demand for virtual interior design 
services that provide personalized recommendations without the need for physical presence.
Business Idea: Launch a platform that connects users with virtual interior designers. Users can upload 
pictures of their spaces, and designers can provide tailored suggestions for furniture, decor, and color 
schemes. The platform could facilitate the purchase of recommended items directly.
My assessment: I do not think this is a good business opportunity as this has been done many times before
by many huge furniture companies including Ikea. This would get lost and not gain enough traffic to keep
a stable business. I do think the aspect of adding pictures of personal space is a good element but I do not 
think that would be enough to bring in customers. 

Educational Gaming for Kids:
Capitalize on the intersection of education and entertainment by creating an educational gaming platform 
for children.
Develop interactive and engaging games that focus on various subjects, fostering learning through play.
Include features that allow parents and educators to track progress and customize content based on the 
child's educational needs.
My assessment: This is a great business opportunity because although there are already many educational 
games for kids, the gaming community is a great place to be unique. There are many different games to 
choose from and thatâs what makes kids want to come back and play. Adding the educational element 
would bring in even more business because these games could be catered to schools and various age 
groups. 
If I were interested in pursuing one, I think it would be educational gaming for kids. Game design is very 
creative and allows for uniqueness in work. The gaming industry is also a very big business and I think if 
you make a game well and for the right audience it will go far.",,,,,,,,Do you have the sskills for game design or know someone who does? There are opportunities for someone but the best ones are the ones you can do something about. ,,,
MA,0,Fall,AI,6,"Here are my 5 ranked from worst to best, The prompt I used was: Give me 5 modern business oppurtunities.
Eco-Friendly Products and Services: With a growing emphasis on sustainability and environmental consciousness, businesses that offer eco-friendly products or services are in high demand. This includes everything from sustainable fashion and zero-waste stores to renewable energy solutions and green consulting services.

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Development: VR and AR technologies are becoming increasingly popular in various industries, from gaming and education to healthcare and real estate. Starting a business that focuses on VR/AR content creation, app development, or hardware solutions can be a lucrative opportunity.

Health and Wellness Services: The health and wellness industry continues to expand, with opportunities in areas such as mental health counseling, fitness coaching, healthy meal delivery services, and wellness retreats. Additionally, businesses related to alternative and holistic medicine are gaining traction.

E-commerce and Niche Marketplaces: E-commerce is evolving, and there are opportunities to create specialized online marketplaces for niche products or communities. Examples include platforms for artisanal and handmade goods, vintage collectibles, or unique hobbyist products.

Remote Work Solutions: The shift towards remote work has created a demand for businesses that cater to remote workers' needs. This includes services like virtual team-building activities, home office setup consultations, and remote work productivity tools.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
MB,1,Fall,AI,6,"Order of what I believed to be good business opportunities: #3, #1, #5, #4, #2
Opportunity #1: Is creating a business that will compose/write music for people's specific 
occasions a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a business that specializes in composing or writing music for 
specific occasions can be a viable and potentially lucrative business opportunity. Music is a 
fundamental element of many important life events and occasions, including weddings, corporate 
events, films, commercials, and more. Customized music can add a unique and personal touch to 
these events, making them more memorable and special for the individuals involved.
Here are some factors to consider when assessing the feasibility of this business opportunity:
â¢ Market Demand: Conduct thorough market research to determine the demand for 
customized music for specific occasions. Identify the target audience and their 
preferences to understand the potential size of the market.
â¢ Competition: Analyze the existing competition in this niche. Identify what makes your 
services unique and how you can differentiate your business from others in the market.
â¢ Expertise and Talent: Ensure that you have a team of skilled and experienced 
composers and musicians who can create high-quality, personalized music that meets the 
clients' specific requirements.
â¢ Marketing and Networking: Develop a strong marketing strategy to promote your 
services. Build connections with event planners, wedding coordinators, advertising 
agencies, and other professionals who may require customized music for their projects.
â¢ 
Intellectual Property Rights: Be clear about the ownership and usage rights of the 
composed music. Establish clear agreements with clients regarding the ownership and 
licensing of the music you create for them.
â¢ Technology and Equipment: Invest in the necessary technology and equipment to 
produce professional-quality music compositions. Stay updated with the latest music 
production software and tools to deliver high-quality results.
â¢ Legal and Financial Considerations: Understand the legal requirements for setting up a 
music composition business. Consider consulting with legal and financial experts to 
ensure compliance with regulations and to manage your finances effectively.
If you can effectively address these considerations and cater to the needs of your target audience, 
a business focused on composing music for specific occasions can indeed be a promising and 
rewarding venture.
Assessment: ChatGPTâs insights were very helpful for consideration of this business idea. It 
mentioned that I need to consider what makes my business special and that would be the fact that 
it would be accessible and affordable to many people rather than just those who have 
connections to a music artist. I may consider a business opportunity because I have a background 
in music and am currently working on a commercial music degree. I also have a few friends that 
could be interested in taking on this idea with me, and so I could create a team of music 
composers to make more opportunities for earning money.

Opportunity #2: Is creating a tv show series showcasing young/ new to the industry animation 
artists to show off their work and allow them to build a portfolio for larger studios a good 
business idea?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a TV show series that showcases young or new animation artists and 
allows them to exhibit their work can be an innovative and potentially valuable business idea. 
Such a concept not only provides a platform for budding artists to display their talent but also 
serves as a means for them to build a portfolio and gain exposure to larger studios and industry 
professionals. Here are some aspects to consider when evaluating the viability of this business 
idea:
â¢ Market Interest: Research the demand for such content in the market. Explore the 
interests of your target audience and assess whether there is a significant viewership for 
content focused on emerging animation artists.
â¢ Content Curation: Curate and present the content in a manner that is engaging and 
appealing to a broad audience. Consider incorporating educational aspects, behind-the-
scenes insights, and inspirational stories to make the show more relatable and captivating.
â¢ Networking Opportunities: Use the show as a platform for networking and 
collaboration. Facilitate connections between the featured artists and established 
professionals in the animation industry to create potential job opportunities and 
mentorship programs.
â¢ Legal Considerations: Understand the legal aspects involved in showcasing the work of 
emerging artists. Ensure that you have the necessary rights and permissions to display 
their artwork and protect their intellectual property.
â¢ 
Sponsorship and Partnerships: Explore opportunities for partnerships and sponsorships 
with animation studios, educational institutions, and industry organizations. Collaborate 
with these entities to provide additional resources and support for the showcased artists.
â¢ Promotion and Distribution: Develop a comprehensive marketing and distribution 
strategy to reach a wider audience. Utilize various platforms and mediums, including 
social media, streaming services, and animation festivals, to promote the show and the 
featured artists.
â¢ Long-term Sustainability: Plan for the long-term sustainability of the TV show by 
considering potential revenue streams, such as advertising, sponsorships, licensing, and 
merchandise sales.
By addressing these considerations and effectively executing the concept, you can create a TV 
show series that not only benefits the participating animation artists but also contributes to the 
growth and development of the animation industry as a whole.
Assessment: ChatGPTâs insights into this business idea were very interesting. I liked its
suggestion of also incorporating a behind the scenes portion of the show as an inspiration to 
young artists so people can witness the creative process as well as the finished product. If I have 
the right people to help me start this project, I will consider this as a potential business idea; 
however, I donât think I can start this venture on my own.

Opportunity #3: Would a business that rents out a music production studio complete with DAWs 
and MIDI technology be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Establishing a business that offers music production studios for rent, equipped 
with Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and MIDI technology, can indeed be a promising 
business opportunity. With the growing popularity of music production and the increasing 
number of aspiring musicians and producers, there is a demand for accessible and well-equipped 
studio spaces. Here are some factors to consider when evaluating the feasibility of this business 
idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Conduct thorough market research to understand the demand for 
music production studios in your target location. Identify the needs of your potential 
customers, including independent musicians, producers, and recording artists.
â¢ Quality Equipment: Invest in high-quality DAWs, MIDI controllers, studio monitors, 
microphones, and other essential recording equipment to ensure that your studio meets 
industry standards. Offer a range of equipment suitable for various music production 
needs and genres.
â¢ 
Studio Space: Create a well-designed, acoustically treated studio space that 
accommodates different recording needs. Consider offering both soundproofed recording 
booths and larger production rooms to cater to a diverse clientele.
â¢ Technical Support: Provide technical assistance and support to clients who may be less 
experienced with the equipment. Employ knowledgeable staff who can assist with setting 
up the equipment and troubleshooting any technical issues.
â¢ Flexible Rental Options: Offer flexible rental packages to accommodate the varying 
needs and budgets of different clients. Consider providing hourly, daily, weekly, and 
monthly rental options to cater to both short-term and long-term projects.
â¢ Marketing and Networking: Develop a strong marketing strategy to promote your 
studio rental services. Build relationships with local musicians, producers, and music 
schools to create a network of potential clients and collaborators.
â¢ Legal and Safety Compliance: Ensure that your studio complies with all legal 
requirements and safety regulations related to music production and studio operations. 
This includes licensing agreements, copyright considerations, and health and safety 
standards.
â¢ Additional Services: Consider offering additional services such as mixing and mastering 
assistance, production workshops, and networking events to add value to your studio 
rental business.
By addressing these factors, you can establish a music production studio rental business that 
caters to the needs of both amateur and professional musicians and producers, providing them 
with a well-equipped and conducive environment to create and produce music.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights and makes this seem like it could be a 
promising business venture. As a commercial music major I may one day have to purchase all of 
this equipment on my own (including the space to put it). Renting the space/equipment while Iâm 

not using it could be an excellent way to pay for/make money off of my equipment other than 
just creating music.
Opportunity #4: Is creating a social media just for people to post reviews and thoughts on books 
a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a specialized social media platform dedicated to book reviews and 
discussions can indeed be a promising business opportunity, especially given the continued 
popularity of reading and the growing online community of book enthusiasts. Here are some 
aspects to consider when evaluating the feasibility of this business idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Assess the demand for a dedicated platform for book reviews and 
discussions. Analyze the size of the target audience, their preferences, and the existing 
platforms they currently use for similar purposes.
â¢ User Experience: Design a user-friendly and engaging platform that encourages active 
participation and fosters meaningful discussions among book lovers. Incorporate features 
such as personalized recommendations, user-generated content, and interactive book-
related activities to enhance the overall user experience.
â¢ Content Moderation: Implement robust content moderation tools to maintain a high 
standard of quality for reviews and discussions. Encourage constructive and respectful 
conversations while minimizing the impact of spam and irrelevant content.
â¢ Community Building: Foster a strong sense of community among users by organizing 
virtual book clubs, author Q&A sessions, and literary events. Create opportunities for 
users to connect with like-minded individuals and form meaningful relationships based 
on their shared love for literature.
â¢ Monetization Strategies: Explore various monetization strategies, such as targeted 
advertising, premium memberships, sponsored content, and affiliate partnerships with 
bookstores and publishers, to generate revenue and sustain the platform's operations.
â¢ Mobile Accessibility: Ensure that the platform is optimized for mobile devices, as many 
users prefer to access social media platforms on their smartphones and tablets. Develop a 
user-friendly mobile app to enhance accessibility and user engagement.
â¢ Legal Considerations: Familiarize yourself with the legal aspects of content sharing and 
user-generated reviews. Implement clear guidelines for copyright compliance, user 
privacy, and data protection to protect both the users and the platform.
â¢ Competitive Analysis: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing book review 
platforms and identify unique features or services that can set your platform apart and 
attract a dedicated user base.
By addressing these considerations and providing a well-curated platform that caters to the 
specific needs and interests of book enthusiasts, you can create a thriving online community that 
fosters a love for reading and facilitates meaningful interactions among avid readers.
Assessment: ChatGPTâs encouragement of how this business opportunity could be successful 
was good; however, I donât think I would necessarily pursue this because I feel that out of the 
other business ideas I had, this would be the hardest to make money from.

Opportunity #5: Would a business that sells specifically college student supplies be a good 
business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Establishing a business that specifically caters to college student supplies can 
indeed be a promising business opportunity. College students have unique and diverse needs, and 
providing them with convenient access to essential supplies can be a valuable service. Here are 
some factors to consider when evaluating the feasibility of this business idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Research the demand for college student supplies in your target area. 
Understand the specific needs of college students, including stationery, textbooks, study 
aids, dorm room essentials, and other academic resources.
â¢ Product Selection: Curate a comprehensive selection of products that are tailored to the 
requirements of college students. Offer a diverse range of items, including textbooks, 
notebooks, writing instruments, backpacks, dorm room furniture, and tech gadgets, to 
cater to various academic and lifestyle needs.
â¢ Convenience and Accessibility: Ensure that your business provides convenient access to 
supplies for college students, whether through a physical retail location near college 
campuses or through an accessible online platform with fast and reliable delivery 
services.
â¢ Competitive Pricing: Offer competitive pricing to attract price-sensitive college 
students. Consider implementing student discounts, bundle offers, and loyalty programs 
to incentivize repeat purchases and foster customer loyalty.
â¢ Partnerships and Collaborations: Collaborate with educational institutions, student 
organizations, and campus bookstores to establish partnerships and increase your 
business's visibility among the student community. Explore opportunities for 
sponsorships and promotional events to expand your reach and market presence.
â¢ 
Seasonal and Trend-based Products: Stay updated with the latest academic trends and 
seasonal demands among college students. Introduce new products and services that align 
with the evolving needs and preferences of the student population, such as eco-friendly 
supplies, digital learning tools, and wellness products.
â¢ Online Presence and Marketing: Develop a strong online presence through a user-
friendly website and active engagement on social media platforms. Implement targeted 
digital marketing strategies to reach and connect with college students, including email 
campaigns, social media advertising, and influencer partnerships.
â¢ Customer Service: Prioritize excellent customer service by providing personalized 
assistance, easy returns, and timely responses to student inquiries and feedback. Create a 
positive shopping experience that encourages students to return and recommend your 
business to their peers.
By considering these factors and providing a comprehensive range of college student supplies 
along with excellent customer service, you can establish a successful business that meets the 
unique needs of the college student demographic.
Assessment: I like the insights that ChatGPT offers for this business venture. Especially the 
thoughts of keep on latest trends such as eco-friendly materials and digital resources. I like this 
business opportunity and I think it would be profitable; however, I would pursue a few of the 
other business ideas before this one simply because it doesnât interest me as much.",,,,,,,,"Nice! How interested and how doable are two easy and great ways to evaluate whether an idea is a ""good"" opportunity.",,,

energy solutions. Success depends on expertise, regulatory knowledge, and access to the 
latest green technologies.
AI-Powered Personalized Education:
Opportunity: Develop an AI-driven platform for personalized education, catering to individual 
learning needs.
Evaluation: The education sector is ripe for disruption. AI-driven personalized learning can 
be highly effective, but it requires substantial content development and addressing 
privacy concerns.
Urban Farming and AgTech:
Opportunity: Establish an urban farming venture, leveraging advanced agricultural technologies 
to produce fresh, local produce.
Evaluation: Urban farming addresses food security and sustainability concerns. However, 
upfront costs, space limitations, and technology requirements must be carefully managed.
Each of these opportunities has potential, but they also come with their unique challenges. 
Evaluating their feasibility would require a detailed business plan, market research, and a 
thorough understanding of the specific industry and regulatory landscape.

are possible for businesses and entrepreneurs to build their own business. With these 
opportunities, also comes struggles and problems. Some of these may come down to market 
competition, operational issues, time management, etc. Potential that comes with being an 
entrepreneur includes financial independence, creative control, personal fulfillment, networking 
opportunities, etc.",,,,,,,,Nice! Way to use ChatGPT to evaluate the areas of risk as well. Perhaps you may want to try different prompts with ChatGPT to give you more desirable ideas.

Eco-Friendly Cleaning Service
1. 
: Start a cleaning company that specializes in 
using environmentally friendly and non-toxic cleaning products. Many consumers
are becoming increasingly conscious of the impact of traditional cleaning 
chemicals on health and the environment. You could offer home and office 
cleaning services that cater to this growing demand.
Virtual Health and Wellness Coaching
2. 
: With the increasing focus on health and 
well-being, you could offer virtual health and wellness coaching services. Provide 
personalized guidance on nutrition, fitness, stress management, and overall well-
being via video calls and a dedicated app. This business could serve individuals, 
corporate clients, or specific niche markets like post-pregnancy fitness or stress 
management for professionals.
Tech Repair and Support
3. 
: As technology becomes an integral part of our lives, 
the demand for tech repair and support services is rising. You can set up a 
business that repairs smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets. Additionally, offer
tech support services for software issues, troubleshooting, and setup assistance.
Customized Handmade Crafts
4. 
: Start a business creating and selling unique 
handmade crafts. You could specialize in custom products like personalized 
jewelry, custom home decor, or handcrafted gifts. Selling your products on online
marketplaces like Etsy or through your own website can be a great way to reach a
wide audience.
Urban Farming and Local Produce Delivery
5. 
: With the growing interest in 
organic and locally-sourced food, consider starting an urban farming operation. 
Grow fruits, vegetables, or herbs in an urban or suburban setting and offer a 
subscription-based delivery service to local residents and restaurants. This 
business not only promotes sustainability but also supports the local food 
movement.
I would probably not pursue any of these business ideas because I do not have any interest in 
them. When choosing business ideas, I believe you should pick the one you enjoy the most 
instead of choosing which one is going to be more successful. Doing this will ensure the 
business will do well because you like doing the work. ",,,,,,,,Agreed. Passion becomes a driving motivator when no sign of success is in sight.

1. Prompt:
Output: Remote Work Trends
""Remote Work Efficiency Software"" is an opportunity.
Evaluation: Since working remotely is becoming more popular, software that 
improves teamwork, productivity, and communication is in high demand. Creating
an all-inclusive program for remote work efficiency could help capitalize on this 
expanding market. This proposal is in line with current trends, thus I would be 
interested in exploring it further.
2. Prompt:
Output: Sustainable Living
""Eco-Friendly Home Renovation Services"" is the opportunity.
Evaluation: Living sustainably is a big concern. Reaching out to customers who 
care about the environment could involve providing eco-friendly home renovation
services that emphasize renewable materials, energy efficiency, and a lower 
carbon footprint. This is a growth-oriented opportunity that fits with sustainability 
aims.
3. Prompt:
Output: Healthcare Technology
""Telemedicine Platform for Mental Health"" is an opportunity.
Evaluation: There is a clear demand for easily accessible mental health services 
given the increased attention that mental health concerns have received. It would
be beneficial for society and financially advantageous to establish a telemedicine 
platform with a focus on mental health care. Given the possible advantages of 
this concept, I would think about exploring it.
4. Prompt:
Output: Online Education
The opportunity is in ""AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platforms"".
Assessment: The domain of virtual education is expanding. In this field, an AI-
powered personalized learning platform that customizes course contents to meet 
the needs and learning styles of individual students might be revolutionary. 
Considering that this opportunity combines the newest advancements in 
technology and education, I would be inclined to accept it.
5. Prompt:
Output: Aging Population
""Elderly Care Tech Solutions"" is the opportunity.
Evaluation: The need for senior care solutions is rising as the world's population 
ages. There is a lot of promise in developing tech-based goods and services that 
improve senior citizens' quality of life and safety, including wearable health 
monitors or senior home automation. Because of this field's potential for business
expansion and social impact, I would think about researching it.
To sum up, every one of these prospects corresponds with current patterns and 
developing requirements across different industries. I think every proposal has potential,
and the decision to pursue one would depend on the entrepreneur's interests, 
resources, and experienceâeven if I don't have any personal preferences or the 
capacity to take advantage of any of these prospects",,,,,,,,"Remember the daily practice is more important than turning something in with enough ideas on the same day as other assignments.

MD,1,Fall,AI,6,"âWhat are five businesses that could help solve the average personâs problems?â

Output One: Personal Finance And Budgeting Services

 I consider this business to be the best output for this assignment. Finances are something that every person will have to deal with in one way or another in life, and I think that budgeting and managing your money effectively is a really important skill to have. The first thing that came to mind as far as a business opportunity for this output is a business that partners with schools to teach personal finance to children as they grow up. I think that this way, the schools would be the ones funding this service instead of individuals, and it would be very rewarding to be able to teach young kids smart ways to spend and save and progress into more complex topics such as investing for example as they grew older. That way, they would feel very confident about money by the time that they move out. In my opinion, this is a program that anyone could get behind. 

 Output Two: Mental Health And Wellness Services

This is a business opportunity that was offered in the last ChatGPT prompt that I used, and for good reason! I do think that more and more people are experiencing mental health struggles as time goes on, and itâs important to emphasize how crucial it is to do things everyday that will help you out mentally, physically and spiritually. I can envision a lot happening in the future with mental health businesses. It would be cool to incorporate it with work or school to make sure that employees and students are getting what they need to succeed, or even incorporating it into popular apps like TikTok or Instagram. 

 Output Three: Online Education And Skill Development

  This output was in the running for my favorite opportunity of this assignment, because I think that online education is a great resource and I would love for it to keep growing and become even more accessible for people. A few semesters ago I took all online classes for a semester and was still able to work full time because I had no specific time that I had to dedicate to being in class. I think that that is the appeal of online courses for many, especially older adults that want to pursue their degree, but know that they canât commit to giving up time at their job to attend classes. 

 Output Four: Home Cleaning Services

 This output was interesting to me because originally I dismissed this idea as something that wouldnât be very popular because I tend to think that only people that are very rich can afford to get their house cleaned for them. But I think that there is definitely an opportunity to make affordable home cleaning services that people would be able to utilize when they are busy with work, just had a baby, feeling sick, or are traveling. These are all times when it would be so nice to have someone to help out, and to structure a business in a way that would be affordable to the consumer would make it more popular in my opinion. 

 Output Five: Meal Kit And Delivery Services

To me, this was the worst output of the assignment, not because itâs not a good idea, but because the market for it seems very oversaturated at this point. I feel like adding another meal subscription service or delivery app to the pool of existing ones would be really counterproductive. I definitely do believe that itâs a valuable service, just one that wouldâve thrived as a new business about six or seven years ago.

Input: 5 daily problems that could be turned into entrepreneurial opportunities
Bing Output: Here are 5 common daily problems that could be turned into entrepreneurial 
opportunities:
1. 
Traffic congestion: Traffic congestion is a common problem in many cities around the world. You 
could start a business that provides carpooling services to help people save time and money on 
their daily commute.
2. 
Lack of time: Many people struggle with finding enough time to get everything done in a day. 
You could start a business that provides personal concierge services to help people manage their
busy schedules.
3. 
Food waste: Food waste is a major problem that affects both households and businesses. You 
could start a business that collects food waste from households and businesses and turns it into 
compost or animal feed.
4. 
Lack of healthy food options: Many people struggle to find healthy food options when they are 
on the go. You could start a business that provides healthy meal delivery services to help people 
eat well even when they are busy.
5. 
Lack of affordable housing: Affordable housing is a major issue in many cities around the world. 
You could start a business that provides affordable housing solutions such as micro-apartments 
or co-living spaces.
As for which opportunity I could see myself pursuing, my passions align the most with the food waste 
option as I do consider myself to be a sustainable and environmentally friendly advocate. Especially with 
global warming getting worse and worse, I found myself becoming more involved with concepts such as 
energy saving and wasting less water and food. Since I naturally align with this option, it seems like the 
right choice to pursue in entrepreneurial context. I also see a large audience full of environmentally 
conscious individuals in the modern age who would love to contribute to making the Earth a safer and 
healthier environment for all. It would also make me feel good about myself to contribute to making the 
Earth a better place by collecting other peopleâs food waste and even making something out of it to 
benefit even more creatures like animal feed, while also turning a profit to benefit my own wellbeing.",,,,,,,,Great evaluation.

-Eco-Friendly Pest Control: Start a pest control company that specializes in eco-friendly and non-toxic methods to protect homes and businesses from pests. Many people are seeking environmentally friendly solutions, and this business could cater to that demand.

Offer experiences focused on physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, such as yoga, meditation, adventure activities, and healthy cuisine.

-Senior Concierge Services: Launch a business that offers specialized concierge services for senior citizens. Provide services like transportation, grocery shopping, medication management, and companionship. This business can address the growing need for support in an aging population.

I personally really like the business ideas of personalized wellness retreats and sustainable fashion subscription box. I actually follow some influencer-like people on Instagram who do these kind of retreats. I've noticed only a couple people start this business idea, but I think it's a really unique one. Usually the retreat leaders/developers will offer a certain amount of spots available, and I have noticed that the spots fill up really quickly-- so people must like it. I have considered going on these retreats myself but I usually don't have the time or extra money for it. I think if you gear these retreats towards specific niches it would be really successful. I also like the sustainable fashion subscription idea, because it can be hard to find clothing these days that is sustainable. This would save people time so they don't have to search for these items themselves and it could help educate people too who don't know a lot about it. ",,,,,,,,Nice!

If you have a flair for design and enjoy working with spaces, starting a home renovation and interior design business could be a great idea. You can offer services ranging from simple interior decoration consultations to full-scale home renovations. With the right marketing and skills, you can tap into a lucrative market.

This business idea tends to be popular these days. If you have a nack for design and know how to use tools and work with these types of things this seems like a fantastic idea. Renovating houses can be a really good money maker if done correctly. Buying houses for low and renovating houses to improve them is a good idea if you know what your doing and you're in a good market for it I would definitley consider doing something like this if my abilities for this specific thing was more sharpened.

2. Online tutoring platform

With the increasing demand for online education, starting an online tutoring platform can be a lucrative business. You can connect students with qualified tutors for various subjects, languages, or skills. Specializing in high-demand fields like STEM subjects or test preparation can give you an edge.

This is a really good idea, However Most schools offer this type of thing for students that are online. If you could figure out a program with tutoring that could be combined with healthy tools to become a better student and other good habits that go beyond the classroom I believe this would be something that could be beneficial for people around the country. You could charge a monthly fee or a one time only fee. It would be really cool if you could have these study sevices in each city so you could meet wiith people in person to study.

3. Virtual Assistant Services

Many entrepreneurs and businesses are looking for virtual assistants to help with tasks like email management, scheduling, data entry, and social media management. You can start a business offering virtual assistant services to small businesses and busy professionals.

This seems like a great idea, I dont know if something like this already exists however I feel like this could be extremely succesful and helpful for business owners. It also could allow for people to be freelance virtual assistance for maybe a few different companies at a time. By working through freelance business you could make a portion of the money the actual virtual assistant is making from the business and thats how you could make your money. It also would allow you to work from anywhere at anytime.

4. Fitness and Wellness coach 

Health and wellness are always in demand. You can start a business as a fitness coach or a wellness consultant. This could involve creating personalized workout and diet plans, offering online yoga or meditation classes, or even developing a fitness app. As people are becoming more health-conscious, this industry has a lot of potential.

including STEM, humanities, and even specialized skills like programming or language

2. Student Housing Solutions: Finding affordable, convenient, and safe housing is a

Specializing in destination wedding photography allows you to capture the beauty of these unique settings while providing a high-end experience for couples who want to document their special day in a luxurious way.â 


2. Fine Art Film Photography:

âLuxury clients often appreciate the artistry and timeless quality of film photography. Embracing film as your medium of choice can set you apart from digital photographers. Consider offering hybrid photography packages that include both digital and film coverage to cater to a broader clientele.â


3. High-End Bridal Portraits:âIn addition to wedding day coverage, offer luxurious bridal portrait sessions. These sessions can be held in beautiful and picturesque locations and may involve multiple outfit changes and stylized shoots, providing couples with stunning, magazine-worthy images.â


4. Exclusive Photo Albums and Prints:

âLuxury clients often seek high-quality printed products. Offer custom-designed, handcrafted photo albums and fine art prints that showcase your work beautifully. These products can be premium additions to your photography packages and provide lasting memories for couples.â

âCollaborating with high-end wedding planners and vendors can help you gain access to exclusive, upscale weddings. Partner with luxury wedding planners to provide photography services as part of their packages, ensuring that you are the preferred photographer for their clients.â


I find that the opportunity in all of the generated topics was extreme. The only one that, being a wedding photographer, I donât see as a big opportunity or at least not as much as the others is the Photo Albums and Prints. I find that when using prints and albums, especially when using high end ones, you have to charge hundreds of dollars to make a profit or make it worth your time. The profit to work margin isnât worth it, in my opinion. The rest of the options seem great, especially fine art film photography because getting to work with luxury clients leads to amazing opportunities for travel and life experiences. One thing that I find in weddings is having to read a personâs emotions and how they are feeling. A lot of times on a wedding day, the person is over the photos and doesnât want to turn their wedding day into a photoshoot. Being able to read their emotions and not make the day into a photoshoot and keep the mood upbeat and light is a big portion of being a wedding photographer and in my opinion, what separates a good photographer and an average photographer.

AT,1,Fall,AI,6,"Business solutions for expensive housingâ
The Opportunities (in order from best to worst):
1. Rent-to-Own Programs
a. Develop a business that offers rent-to-own programs, allowing people to rent a
home with the option to purchase it at a later date. This can make homeownership
more accessible for many.
i. 
I put this opportunity first because I could see there being a great reward
and payoff for the business owner. However, where there is the
opportunity for great reward, there is also the possibility for high risk. In
my personal opinion, I think that this is the way that all housing should
operate. So I have a personal passion towards this opportunity that excites
me and interests me. In order to reduce some of the risk, care would have
to be taken to protect the business owner from being taken advantage of,
possibly through a contract. This would be a long term program which
might turn people off, but I think it could also help to build trust.
2. Micro-Housing
a. Develop compact and efficient housing units, often referred to as micro-housing
or tiny homes, which can be a more affordable housing solution.
i. 
Personally, I love this idea. I ranked this opportunity second instead of
first because it is probably not ideal for most people. This type of business
would work best if targeted towards one or two person homes. Families
with children or multiple generations probably wouldnât want to squeeze
themselves into a micro house. However, it is likely to assume that one or
two person households are who would benefit most from affordable
housing because they might only have one or two sources of income. With
larger households, there are usually multiple sources of income. I think
micro housing is also a very modern idea. Tiny homes are very popular
right now and I donât see them going out of style anytime soon. Itâs a
fairly new idea so thereâs minimal competition. This would give the
business brand equity and set it apart from others. Minimalists might also
be attracted to micro housing.

ii. 
Out of all the ideas for opportunities, I think this is the one I would be
most likely to pursue. I have always wanted to purchase property(ies) and
furnish them into AIRBnBs or rentals. I have often looked at other
AIRBnBs and there are a few that have caught my eye that are actually
tiny homes. Thereâs also a somewhat famous show about tiny homes too.
From a business standpoint, it wouldnât cost a lot of money to build and to
maintain. Thereâs a good chance for higher payout and itâs beneficial to
the community.
3. Housing Cooperatives
a. Establish housing cooperatives where residents collectively own and manage the
housing, which can lead to lower costs and more affordable living arrangements.
i. 
This is a very intriguing idea for a business opportunity. Iâve never heard
of a system like it and I think that it sounds like it has multiple benefits. I
ranked it at third best because I need more information on the opportunity.
Itâs not clear how exactly a system like this would work. I think that in
order for it to run smoothly, the members would need to be educated as
well which cannot be guaranteed. When it comes to problem solving and
finding solutions within the cooperatives, I think there could be some
difficulty and bias.
4. Co-Housing Communities
a. Build co-housing communities where multiple families or individuals share
common spaces and facilities, reducing the overall cost of housing.
i. 
I do think that this is a good idea, however the reason I ranked it fourth is
because I donât think it would be an ideal situation for most people. I think
that this is a nice option for people who need it as a last resort, but I donât
think anyone would desire to live in a co-housing community as most
people value their privacy. I do think something like this would be
important for a community to have. There will always be people who need
a place to live that is within their budget but I donât see it as a place for
long term stays. I think that the success of this business opportunity would
ultimately depend on the city and just how reduced the cost of housing is.
If the housing is cheap, I could see people not taking very good care of the
space which may create and increase expenses for the business.
5. Transport-Oriented Development
a. 
Invest in real estate development near public transportation hubs to make housing
more accessible and reduce the need for personal vehicles.
i. 
I think this idea has some merit but from the sounds of it, the housing
itself wouldnât be discounted or decreased. Instead, this opportunity

reduces the cost of another aspect of life to make expenses less overall. It
would also be difficult to ensure that the transportation hub goes to
everyone's place. I thought this was the worst out of the opportunities
because it doesnât really do anything to solve the problem directly and it
also brings up many more questions and issues",,,,,,,,"I know playing with ChatGPT can be fun but the idea of the daily assignments is so that you will practice daily, not so you do a certain amount of busy work.

MW,1,Fall,AI,6,"Question/Opportunity 1:
I'm interested in the paranormal, but I really care about spiritual protection and I'm scared of putting myself out in paranormal places in an exposing way. I am someone who is more in tune with energy and more likely to experience something beyond the veil. What opportunities stem from my situation that would be safe to explore?
Chat GPT's Answer:
It's perfectly normal to be interested in the paranormal while also being concerned about spiritual protection and your personal well-being. There are plenty of safe and responsible ways to explore your interest in the paranormal and metaphysical realms while maintaining a focus on spiritual protection. Here are some opportunities for you to consider:
Join Paranormal Investigation Groups: Many paranormal investigation groups take safety and protection seriously. They often have experienced members who can guide you and teach you how to protect yourself while exploring the paranormal. You can learn from their expertise and participate in investigations in a group setting.
Online Forums and Communities: Join online forums or social media groups dedicated to the paranormal and spiritual topics. You can share your experiences, learn from others, and seek advice on how to protect yourself while exploring the unknown.

Read and Study: Dive into books, articles, and online resources about the paranormal and spirituality. Educating yourself about different practices, protection methods, and experiences can help you feel more prepared.

Meditation and Energy Work: Practice meditation and energy work to develop your spiritual awareness and protection skills. These practices can help you strengthen your inner defenses and create a safe space within yourself.

Consult Spiritual Experts: Seek guidance from spiritual practitioners, energy healers, or psychics who can provide insights into your spiritual protection and help you explore the paranormal safely.

Dream Journaling: Keep a dream journal to explore your experiences in the dream realm. This can be a safe way to connect with the paranormal while maintaining a level of separation from physical encounters.

Exploration Through Art and Writing: Express your experiences and interests through art, creative writing, and storytelling. This allows you to explore the paranormal in a controlled and imaginative way.

Attend Workshops and Conferences: Look for workshops, conferences, and events related to the paranormal and spirituality. These can provide valuable insights, knowledge, and opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals in a safe and structured environment.

Nature and Spiritual Retreats: Spend time in nature and attend spiritual retreats to connect with the natural world and explore your spiritual side. Being in nature often provides a sense of protection and grounding.

Establish Personal Protection Rituals: Develop your own personal protection rituals or practices, such as visualization, grounding exercises, or prayers, to ensure you are spiritually protected when exploring the paranormal.

Volunteer and Charity Work: Consider channeling your interest in the paranormal into community service or charity work. Helping others can be a spiritually fulfilling way to balance your paranormal curiosity.

Remember, your spiritual protection and well-being should always be a top priority. Trust your instincts, and if you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a paranormal situation, it's crucial to step back and reassess. By approaching the paranormal with respect, knowledge, and safety in mind, you can explore your interests in a responsible and fulfilling manner.

Reflection: 

I could dive into the suggestions above and be educated more on the subject so later on I could explore more entrepreneurial options around the paranormal, like starting my own paranormal business or using tarot cards to communicate in a smart and safe way as a business. As long as I feel comfortable doing it.

It also creates a range of business and career opportunities in technology development, implementation, and data analysis.

Reflection:

This sounds like the next best thing! However, we would be trusting AI technology to catagorize our systems and AI is still flawed in development. We'd also be risking confidentiality as well since this is the case. It will take a number of years before this happens. I think that day will be cool though. Who knows? It might get invented tomorrow.


Final Reflection:

I'd say the opportunity of opening a coffee shop with my dad and pursing music in an entrepreneurial way would be what I'm most interested out of the 5. I guess I would be directly involved with making these things happen and they seem the most tangible. I like having a say in the ideas I come up with. ",,,,,,,,Nice!,,,
BW,1,Fall,AI,6,"I asked CGPT to give me 5 products that would solve the struggle of putting posters up and this is what it said: 

Poster Hangers and Rails: Poster hangers and rails are a convenient way to display posters without damaging the walls. These products consist of top and bottom rails that securely hold the poster in place, making it easy to change posters whenever needed. They are a great solution for businesses and individuals who frequently update their posters.

Double-Sided Tape and Poster Putty: Double-sided tape and poster putty are adhesive products designed to safely and temporarily secure posters to walls without leaving residue. They are ideal for renters or those who want to avoid damaging surfaces. Poster putty is reusable and provides a secure hold without damaging the poster.

Poster Frames and Display Cases: Poster frames and display cases provide a protective and stylish way to showcase posters. These products come in various sizes and materials, including wood, plastic, and aluminum. They not only protect posters from damage but also enhance their visibility and longevity.

Magnetic Poster Holders: Magnetic poster holders consist of magnetic strips that hold posters in place on metal surfaces such as refrigerators or magnetic whiteboards. These are practical for displaying posters in homes, offices, or schools without the need for adhesives.

Poster Storage Tubes: Poster storage tubes are designed to protect posters during transportation and storage. They are particularly useful for event organizers, artists, or anyone who needs to keep posters in good condition. These tubes prevent posters from creasing, tearing, or getting damaged.

Some address my problem and others do not. I agree the most with the magnetic posters and I want to expand on it a little more because another issue is having it be aligned with the other side. What if a poster came with two magnets on a stick and the gravitational pull only happens once they are aligned with each other, then you can magnetically press the magnets on the poster along with the two on the wall. ",,,,,,,,Nice! I love the brainstorming use around a specific problem. Adding constraints to your prompts actually can produce more viablle or desirable ideas. It can also be good for discovering competitors since it tends to use what is out there on the web to answer questions.,,,

Brian Gramm noticed that a solar generator make tailgating easier, and then started thinking about how he could market it to other consumers to grow the business into areas such as homes and construction sites. While being interviewed, he would often give answers that skipped over his thought process, and the person who was interviewing Brian Gramm would stop him and ask him more detailed questions, like ""why did you go to Alabama?"" Brian went to Alabama to use his Peppermint Energy product in real time so people could see how his product is filled their need. 

He started the podcast talking about the decision tree.What do people need? Could I fill that need? Is that a product that already exists? The whole interview is about breaking down every thought process so you can better understand how opportunity are revealed. Brian even speaks about how not all good ideas deserve to be a business, but they are still important for the creative process.Throughout the week I will continue to identify needs around me and think about how that product could be sold, who it would be sold to, how many people would be involved in creating that product and the financial start up behind it. I find myself even know asking the people around me more detailed questions about how they came to conclusions, or asking for more specific responses to questions.

HM,1,Spring,Reflection,7,"Writerâs block is very real and something that isnât taken seriously until you suffer from it
first-hand. For an entrepreneur way shaped of thinking, writerâs block is less common. However, 
I still suffered from this slightly a few days ago. Some days I am flowing with ideas and others, 
not so much. I have very high expectations and goals for myself. Dealing with not being able to 
come up with something to put down on paper on the fly is very dismal for me personally. An

After listening to the podcast âReturn on Investmentâ with business owner and former 
Shark Tank winner Brian Brasch. I learned quite a lot about how the mind of an entrepreneur 
works and how they are always thinking and being creative to come up with new ideas and 
products. I think one thing that is similar between me and Brian is that I have had scenarios 
where I've been looking at companies products and thought of a different approach or idea that 
would make the company more successful or smooth running. The other aspect I also find 
myself relating to is not having the guts to make a leap and start something and I believe itâs 
also because of my lack of knowledge in the field. I donât trust myself yet to actually dive in and 
take the risk. 
One thing I want to work on is reading and learning about how to start a business so I 
can actually take a leap and start a company. Secondly, Brian made it apparent that you should 
be fluent in either accounting or law. I think it would be beneficial to learn about one or both and 
try to become fluent in the language and know as much as possible about it.",,,,,,,,"Nice! As far as being fluent in accounting or legal, you don't need to be an accountant or a lawyer you just need to understand some concepts like how to create an income statement, buying and giving credit, tracking your cash flow, or how contracts work.

I listened to the episode Opportunities Processing where Adam Kaslikowski was interviewed. 
Some things that I did similar to him were pulling his ideas from experience and what he already 
knows about a certain market and how he can put that knowledge to use in a new business idea. 
In the daily exercises, we learned how to look for opportunities in our everyday life. This 
entrepreneur is very driven by internal motivation for the businesses he has started and that has 
helped him gain excitement for the ideas he has generated. That excitement has helped him put 
his ideas into real businesses. Throughout this week I have learned that I need to look for things 
that either excite me or bring me motivation when looking into experiences that I have faced 
from day to day. One thing that I would like to take away from this entrepreneur is how he 
evaluates his ideas and how he can determine if an idea is worth putting effort into. I like this 
attribute because I think itâs important to know when to walk away from an idea rather than keep 
trying to make it work, that way you lose out on more and more the longer you do it, and it

MA,0,Fall,Reflection,7,"I think it's interesting how the first guy that spoke said that his best oppurtunities come from within what he already knows about, allowing him to see what to adjust and make better for people. For example, he spoke on his journey in crossfit as he learned more about the fitness industry he knew what he could fix and make better which put him in a position to make money off fitness. This is essentially the same thing I have been doing with my hobbies and interests, those being weightlifting and making music, as I've progressed through these things I have started to notice more about what I can make easier or more conveniant people, this last week especially has helped with that as I've been trying to enhance my entrepreneur mindset.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,

I listened to the podcast episode of Entrepreneurâs Apprentice titled âBusiness Model-
Derrin Hill.â It was mostly about Derrin Hillâs Journey of coming up with the concept and 
designing the business model for Rev Roadâa business that assists in the success of new 
entrepreneurs. I found several points of this podcast to be very insightful. One specific point that 
stuck with me was when Hill said that âthe worth of knowing an answer is actually very small 
when the actual value is helping someone else discover the answer rather than tell them the 
answer and that process of self-discovery is really what creates that openness to change.â I find 
this to be one of the most important aspects of not only having an entrepreneurial mindset, but 
also a mindset of being successful in any aspect of life. The ability to want to pursue the 
answer/solution to a problem is a key element in what separates a person who is successful from 
a person who is likely to be unsuccessful, because they wonât give up. An entrepreneur is one 
who takes risks, and if one doesnât strive to pursue a solution, what risks is one taking? I have 
that drive to pursue a solution to a problem and will not give up until itâs figured out. This 
includes moments while completing schoolwork, tasks at my job, and day-to-day life. My 
mentality to not give up on a task until itâs complete is one that makes a great entrepreneur.",,,,,,,,Great analysis! So what are you going to stick at this week with your daily practice?,,,
SC,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"Episode listened to: Opportunities Processing - Adam Kaslikowski
From listening to this episode, I found myself finding more similar things to the 
entrepreneur Adam Kaslikoski. From the beginning of the episode he claims that he and another 
partner jumped into a car clubhouse business. He strives in confidence of wanting to make this 
business and partner with his friend right away. I can relate to his confidence because I am a very
confident individual with many passions. Personally, I donât think I would ever want to create 
my own business. However, I can relate to his confidence of knowing what he wants to do and 
making a decision right away. Another similar concept Adam and I have together is always 
thinking of possibilities down the road. I am always thinking about the future constantly, at least 
once a week. Some things that are included in this are professional career, relationships, social 
impact, and more. One thing that I do differently from this entrepreneur is not starting an 
entrepreneurial business for a fun experience. I understand the concept of his statement from the 
podcast, however, starting your own business should be fun in different terms because it can be 
exciting, creative, etc. Although, starting your own business can come with challenges and 
different times. 
With developing an entrepreneurial mindset, many key factors take a part of it for an 
individual. With being a young business driven individual, I try my absolute best to always be 
networking and making connections with other individuals. I found my internship through 
having connections in life and LinkedIn. I strive to keep passion and drive for my future. 
Considering that statement, it is important to always have motivation professionally and in your 
personal life. With my first internship I had this past summer, I learned to be consistent with 
having passion and drive over the course of the time I spent there. Being an entrepreneur it is 
also important to have adaptability. Adaptability can be within new ideas for business, new 
strategies, etc. New ideas will always be thrown out to you while being an entrepreneur. As I 
grow more professionally, I will take in consideration important entrepreneurial factors such as 
financial management, business planning, market research, and learning the risks of the market 
you are heading into. In conclusion, many professional skill sets have to be present in an 
entrepreneur's mind for them to be successful in the end.",,,,,,,,Great analysis! So what do you want to focus on improving this coming week with your daily practices?,,,

MD,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"For this assignment, I decided to listen to the interview with Brian Brasch. One section of this interview that interested me in particular was when Brian was explaining how he is involved with a variety of different businesses that have nothing to do with each other. He described how his business endeavors have really just stemmed from different subjects that he was involved with or interested in at the time. For example, he talked about how his products are fitness related, automobile related and even software related.

This resonated with me because I feel like I do have a bunch of potential business ideas or paths that I could take, but was debating on whether or not I could do different things or if I should stick to a specific niche. This interview was nice to hear because it reminded me that it can work if youâre passionate about multiple subjects! This coming week I want to structure some more of my noticing assignments to be videography related, the field that I am going into.",,,,,,,,"You're right.

In addition, I've been lucky enough to work with professors with actual business experience, which has provided me with priceless insights into how ideas are used in the real world.

I have discovered that my entrepreneurial mindset extends beyond the confines of the business world in my personal life. It has made it possible for me to take a more innovative and flexible approach to possibilities and difficulties. The entrepreneurial attitude has shown to be a useful tool for starting a side hustle, finishing schoolwork, and even better managing my time.",,,,,,,,Nice!

MG,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"I listened to the entrepeneurs opportunities episode with Adam Kaslikowski. The main thing that I picked up is people need to be self aware and learn the things that they are good at. The main thing is to learn your strengths and your weaknesses and what you are able to excel in and run with that. In other words by being able to know what your strengths are you can make them even bigger strengths, but then you can also know what opportunities to take. You will know what things you will be good at and the things that would be a good idea for you to pursue. This way you will be able to take the right steps to be successful, just by being smart and patient with your decisions. 

I need to work on being more patient and waiting for the right opportunities. But also being able to take a good opportunity when I see it. Don't wait too long wanting a better option to come along when there is already a good option. I know my strengthes and my weaknesses but I need to work more on my decision making to be able to be more successful.

JH,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"
I watched the first 20 minutes of the Opportunity identification with Brian Gramm in order to get
a better handle on how entrepreneurs think and process information to develop new solutions and 
opportunities. I noticed the entire time that all the dialogue was centered around one question: would 
there be a market for this product/service/solution etc.? Even before coming up with an actual solution 
or finalized idea the market or audience for a potential opportunity was assessed. This was something I 
tried to incorporate this week but clearly there are experts who think like this 24/7 and can formulate 
these pursuits much easier. I noticed they were also constantly asking the right questions too. This 
appeared along the lines as âis there a better version of this product on the market?â Or âwould people 
buy a better version of this already existing product?â. I sometimes struggle to ask myself questions or 
even to raise my hand and ask questions in class, so this point really stuck out to me because it differs so 
heavily from my normal personality. This only means that I will have to delve deeper into the outside of 
my comfort zone to keep bettering my entrepreneurial skills. 
As for my experiences and expectations for developing such skills, I believe the habit of doing it 
for 3 weeks consecutively will help me build my ability to ask the right questions and determine the 
market availability for any opportunity I can think of. My experience was not too bad this first week 
although I found it challenging at points and it became more strenuous over time to keep coming up 
with opportunities I had seen throughout the day. I have noticed that I have been asking more questions 
across other aspects of my life, such as wondering what a certain type of plant is while walking or 
questions on a deeper level while in class regarding the vocab or material.",,,,,,,,Love to hear your situational awareness is broadening. Keep it up! Try focusing on asking yourself those market questions as you notice things this week. Again even if you notice stuff that doesn't have a market that is great if you can call that out and recognize it because you are refining your evaluation process and getting better at knowing when there might be.,,,
NN,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"I listened to the episode Return on Investment with Brian Brasch. It opened my mind to some new perspectives that I haven't really thought of before. I thought it was interesting how he mentioned that most ideas/opportunities begin with a passion in which you spend your time. He had mentioned in the podcast that some examples from his own life including crossfit training and the automotive industry. He said that in his crossfit gym he was noticing many opportunities for things in which people could benefit from. He also discussed how forming relationships with people when you're trying to grow these opportunites/ideas can be extremely beneficial. The more people who you can connect with and expose your idea to, the more likely you are to be successful. Another aspect I found interesting was how he mentioned that law and accounting are two very important foundational skills. I think accounting is so important because you need to have a basic understanding of what areas your money should be going to in your business and how to allocate your funds accordingly so you can achieve your maximum potential ROI. 

Another part of the podcast I thought was interesting was when he talked about how he went to a t-shirt shop in Hawaii-- he almost walked out but then the store salesperson started talking to him about how they use 100% natural cotton and no animals are harmed in the making of the clothes. Brasch was impressed by this and highlighted that if a company can show people how they give back to the environment and the community, they are more likely to purchase their products. Storytelling can be a really important aspect of selling your product to people-- so knowing how to communicate your brand messaging  effectively and being well-versed on the facts of your company/business idea/etc. is a good idea! Consistency and repeatability is important. 

One last thing he touched on that I found interesting was that ""knowing what to do next and actually having the guts to act on these ideas/opportunities"" can be what makes you successful. If you don't have the guts to actually pursue it, how will you ever know what might be able to happen?

In regards to developing my entrepreneurial mindset, I feel like it is developed most by observing and paying attention to things within my environment. The podcast talked a lot about how many opportunities can come from the passions in which you spend your time. Personally for me, I love all things running, fitness, traveling, fashion, music, etc., and I notice that these are the subjects in which I recognize the most amount of opportunities in. ",,,,,,,,"Great analysis of Brian's interview. It is interesting that he isn't in a major metropolitan area either but in North Dakota.

Podcast Episode: Opportunities Processing -Adam Kaslikowski
 
What do you do that is similar or different than the entrepreneurs being interviewed? 
Something I do that is similar to the entrepreneur being interviewed is he said when he started off when he was young it started as a niche pursuing what he is good at and experienced. This is similar to me because I am in fashion merchandising which creates fashion as my niche which is what I want to pursue. 
Is there anything they demonstrated or modeled that you want to try doing this coming week?
Something the entrepreneur did that I would want to try doing this week would be how he said when he has an idea, he looks for things that is interested in and do not require a lot of money at first and if they are something doable and can look at possibilities. This week I want to come up with more ideas that interest me, that are opportunities that I have experience in.
The process of building a mindset of entrepreneurship is complex and involves traits like risk-taking, adaptability, and creative thinking. I've learned the value of goal setting, networking, risk management, problem-solving, resilience, and flexibility after thinking back on my own experiences and expectations. These abilities have many uses in many facets of life and are not just relevant to entrepreneurship. They are essential in a variety of situations because they help with better problem-solving in academic endeavors, better communication and teamwork in interpersonal connections, and better job advancement. I have used problem-solving in multiple situations related to school, sports, and life situations. Having the ability to be flexible as well as creative thinking has helped me further in leadership roles and in school. In the world of entrepreneurship, these abilities aid in building a solid basis for seeing possibilities, resolving difficulties, and encouraging creativity. Managing the competitive and dynamic world of business requires the capacity to set clear, attainable goals, have a resilient mindset, and adjust to changing circumstances.

MS,0,Fall,Reflection,7,"Podcast:
I thought it was interesting at the beginning Brian Brasch talked about how law or 
accounting is like a language of business. I'm currently in Stats and I can say that itâs not my 
favorite. Taking advantage of working with numbers is something I should do this coming week. 
Looking at stats with a new perspective might make it more enjoyable. I also liked what Brian 
had to say about how a successful business is built on consistency. That caught my attention 
because it makes me think of how I can recreate that âgood experienceâ, whatever it may be, for
everyone. If someone else has this poor experience and another has this great experience then 
where is the credibility of my company? 
Experiences and Expectations:
It is my third year here at CMU and I've had the opportunity to begin to explore the 
entrepreneurial side of myself. My dad is an entrepreneur and began his own business back in 
2003 which evolved into a staple of what my childhood was built around. My dad found a need 
and pursued his dream of owning a business. He started an IT recruiting company that both my 
parents own. So throughout my childhood, I had this entrepreneur side of me that I began to 
notice during my senior year of high school. I started my gym in my basement during COVID-19, 
and I've started my wrestling camps/clubs that I do in the summer, so I have an entrepreneurial 
mindset but Iâm just scratching the surface. 
Some expectations I have in this class and this major is just to continue to grow through 
experience. I feel like the only way you can grow your entrepreneurial mindset is by practice. 
This class is already different than the other classes I have taken because every assignment has 
been applied to my everyday experiences. Overall, I'm pumped to start this journey in 
entrepreneurship at CMU",,,,,,,,"Recreating good experiences is a great way to approach service businesses, which also tend to have lower upfront costs. The trick will be to find a way to make money with out just getting paid for your time. Perhaps this next week you could come up with solutions that were repeatable systems.",,,
GS,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"I think I do multiple things that are similar to Derrin Hill, the man being interviewed when it comes to business models and evaluating them. 

Within my own business, I believe I have been doing multiple things that follow Derrin Hillâs criteria just didnât realize I was doing it. I have played with the idea of starting smaller businesses within my overview of photography like education, guides, and clothing merch. Iâve had business models without even realizing they were actually they were business models. I also looked at the âbig pictureâ of the models like Derrin says you should. 


I believe I have always had an entrepreneurial mindset but have a hard time with the backend of things or the business side of it. When I was little I always was having some sort of lemonade stand or making books or some sort of craft I would âsellâ to my family members so being an entrepreneur comes naturally.  I have been running a successful photography business since I was 15 and have gone full time into wedding and couple photography the last few years. The ideas and execution I never have a problem with, itâs the business details. 


The one downfall to having such an entrepreneurial mindset, at least for me is that when it comes to school, I have a hard time making myself do something if I do not see how it will long-term benefit myself or my business. 


After listening to the podcast it does make me want to take a step back in my business and evaluate the big picture like he says and see how the revenue works within my business and the smaller ones Iâd like to make with it. Is the revenue passive? Is it a one time purchase or reoccurring?

MS2,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"
The part that resonated with me most, from the podcast, was the entrepreneur 
who said he looked for problems or needs in his daily life. When creating my list of 
problems and needs, I look at the things that I would benefit from in day-to-day life. This
method aligns with a user-centric design thinking approach, where solutions are crafted 
by understanding the real needs and challenges of individuals. Additionally, the 
emphasis on practical problem-solving not only serves as a foundation for 
entrepreneurial thinking but also aligns with broader aspects of life. The ability to 
observe, analyze, and address challenges in day-to-day experiences extends beyond 
business into personal development and decision-making. Integrating insights from 
various courses and real-life observations strengthens our entrepreneurial mindset by 
fostering a keen awareness of the world around us and the opportunities it presents. 
This approach is key to not only identifying entrepreneurial ideas but also implementing 
effective and meaningful solutions",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,

I definitely think this upcoming week, making sure I'm looking for more opportunities on a day-to-day basis, is what I'm going to try to do better. Even little ideas that you can have that pop into your head could grow to be maybe one of your biggest business ideas ever.

MW,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"My expectations for this class were that we would be learning from a textbook, taking quizzes and completing homework to prepare for the quizzes, and then later on we would have to come up with a business idea. So far I've been pleasantly surprised about the structure of the class and how it's set up to get us used to brainstorming. I've found that for a majority of my life my thought patterns have always taken me down rabbit holes. The majority of the teachers that I've learned under have discouraged this type of thinking, wanting me to focus on one subject at a time. This class encourages the exact opposite of that and I love it. 

In the podcast episode ""Opportunities Processing - Adam Kaslikowski"", I have never related to anyone's thought process style more than his. When asked a question about how he comes up with the basis of ideas for businesses it was like he was spitballing whatever came to his mind. He would ramble and the interviewer would have to reask and restate questions to keep him on topic. It really showed how fast his brain moves and the amount of ideas he's able to come up with - quite a few. People often assume that presenting as more all over the place makes you not intelligent when it's really the opposite. The way he communicates and is able to come up with so many business ideas give me hope that my thinking process is essential in this type of environment/class. I think one of the things different between Mr. Kaslikowski and I are is that he has broken out of his shell. I still have a lot of work to do to be comfortable with presenting my numerous ideas at the pace he does. This week I want to try and model his structure for opportunity processing and actually document and think out what comes to mind to encourage the process for me more.",,,,,,,,Sounds like your quick brain could be made for the complexity of entrepreneurship.,,,
BW,1,Fall,Reflection,7,"When listening to the opportunities processing episode, I was extremely attracted to what Adam said about his motivation and his mellowness about the business ventures he pursued. He mentioned that he went into business with his friend to get him out of his depressive state during his divorce and then later spoke about how he used that, as well as profitable gain, to boost his motivation. I think that it is very noble of him to invest in something so quickly. He also made me reflect on the idea of how any service that helps people will always be a profitable service because it is a service that completes a frustration of some sort, a problem. Because of that mentality, he finds it very easy to take risks in different ventures. he has changed my mindset because he was not comparing his ventures to other big companies, but asking what can I provide to this region of people.

and poop) of the wheel barrel always freezes and then is impossible to remove. A simple 
solution would be to dump the contents immediately; however, not everyone (me) does 
this. While riding, my horse generally poops and then this is thrown into the wheel barrel.
If left (which it is till full) then it freezes and becomes a frozen brick. Obviously, this is 
irritating to me, and other horse owners, and is a waste of time to spend time removing. 
What if a wheel barrel was insulated so the contents wouldnât freeze? This would be a 
huge hit in the horse world. I personally would use it and I know many others who 
would. A heated barn is also something that could remedy this, but not everyone can 
afford one. Livestock companies, like âFamily, Farm, & Homeâ or âTractor Supply Co.â

He enjoys building racing lawn mowers and he often has trouble finding out ways to build them. He understands how the parts work, but putting them together and making them perform better comes at great tasks and he often finds himself unable to complete certain aspects of the lawn mower engineering. I asked him if there were general blue prints on the mechincal engineering of a lawn mower, and he stated that if there was it would make building them so much simpler.

a face/neck mask? A balaclava mask is not something that first comes to mind when 
venturing out into the cold. I mean, you can always stick your face in your coat rightâ¦ 
(this is a poor decision and does not do well in my experience). So, what if when you buy
your coat, the company provides a complementary balaclava with it? This is not only for 
the wellness and warmth of the customer, but it also boosts the companyâs reputation. The
coat companies most likely already have the material and equipment to make these 
masks. By making these balaclava masks, the company has less waste and more 
employment. These complementary masks provide an increased growth in reputation of 
the company as well. The customers may be more appreciative and willing to âspread the

Storage companies should offer a winterization, cleaning, etc. for assets being stored over

KS,1,Spring,Observation,9,"The first problem I faced was having to wake up early for class after not having classes for 5 days
due to snow. I did not want to get out of bed especially because it was cold, and I felt very tired. 
A normal solution to this would be to go to bed earlier so I donât feel so tired, but I think 
something to just automatically splash water in my face would be the fastest way to get myself 
out of bed.",,,,,,,,"Good descriptions. I would encourage you to consider challenges and constraints of your initial solution because it can help you come up with an even more innovative solution.

I do think this could work. I currently have a tracking app that I use around christmas that uploads all of my tracking numbers and it keeps all them together instead of having to check my email for shipping updates. I imagine this would work similarly. Chat GPT suggest it has translation information for where you are traveling to. This could prove most useful.
Create a new product that would benefit fantasy book readers
The RealmReader is a specialized device designed to enhance the fantasy book reading experience, combining technology and immersive features tailored for avid fantasy readers.
This is a niche market and I think that some components of this service could be sold well. One of those components being themed ambient sounds. This is common scoring in movies, and I think it would make fantasy novel series more attractive to those who may not typically read them.

HM,1,Spring,AI,10,"1. âCat Grooming: Universal Aggression Level Sheetâ. Has a cat ever scratched or bit you? 
Itâs uncomfortable, worrying, and harmful. Groomers should provide their customer a 
universal sheet that has each category of the groom (bathing, nail clipping, drying, 
trimming) and a scale of aggression. This is to ensure the groomerâs safety as well as the 
cats. The owner should be responsible for their pet when setting up an appointment with a
groomer. ChatGPT states that this can be a useful tool for cat groomers and owners. âThis
sheet can help in assessing and communicating a catâs aggression level during grooming 
sessionsâ â ChatGPT. A template is then given. This is a very useful tool and is needed 
amongst the grooming world. This could be changed for other animals as well. ChatGPT 
does a good job when generating this solution. This is what I was looking for when I 
applied this prompt into the search bar. I believe that this solution is innovative because 
you want to prepare for safety at all angles whenever possible. 
2. âWrapping Paper: Buy in Bulk â Get A Fitted Cutterâ. When buying wrapping paper for 
the holidays, itâs cheaper to buy in bulk. However, a lot of wrapping paper gets wasted 
due to not being able to cut it properly (I am a victim). If a bulk supply of wrapping paper
is being purchased, a fitted cutter should be provided as well â as a complementary item. 
ChatGPT does not provide an innovative or unique solution. It states that buying in bulk 
is a cheaper option, but then it lists supplies, variety, etc. Essentially, just tips to âbetterâ 

your next purchase. The fitted cutter idea is just another set of tips when purchasing. This
is not what I was looking for at all. I was hoping for a âpackageâ type thing where you 
buy in bulk and receive a cutter. The potential opportunity here is not worthy. This is not 
something that should be invested in. 
3. âPens: Get Multiple Ink Cartridges with Your Purchaseâ. Do you have a favorite pen? Do
you run out of ink and then have to buy another pen? This is annoying if you ask me. 
What if two or three ink cartridges were supplies in the packaging when purchasing your 
pen? These would be provided in the package with the pen. ChatGPT, again, provides a 
list of tips to make your pen usage easier. So, nothing worth considering. âCompare 
Prices, Brand Promotions, Pen Modelsâ â ChatGPT. What is provided by ChatGPT is 
essentially useless for this prompt. I am not looking for a list of tips and tricks to better 
my pen usage, I wanted a set idea for packaging of a pen and multiple cartridges. What 
was provided is not something I would consider an opportunity or unique. The potential 
is very minimal. 
4. âNew Stove: Recipe Sheet for Cooking with Your New Ovenâ. Do you have trouble 
finding something to eat for dinner seven nights a week? What if your stove came with a 
recipe book? This idea is already being used for other appliances such as blenders and 
bread makers. Why not stoves? ChatGPT provides a way that you can write down your 
own recipes. A template of organization of how to write down your own recipes. I was 
looking for a real recipe book provided by the stove company or a partnering one. I did 
not need to know how to write down my own recipes. The potential opportunity is not 
applicable due to not providing what I was looking for. From ChatGPTâs solution, this is 
not innovative.",,,,,,,,Nice work!,,,
AM,0,Spring,AI,10,"Prompt Used:
Try and generate four separate entrepreneurial opportunities through common inconveniences or problems people may face throughout their day to day life.
ChatGPT Response:

Automated Grocery Shopping Assistant:

Inconvenience: Many people struggle with finding time for grocery shopping amid busy schedules.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Develop a mobile app that utilizes AI to create automated grocery shopping lists based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and past purchases. The app could also partner with local grocery stores for seamless online ordering and delivery.
Virtual Fitness Accountability Platform:

Inconvenience: Maintaining a regular fitness routine can be challenging without proper accountability and motivation.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Create a virtual fitness platform that connects individuals with similar fitness goals. The platform could use AI to track users' progress, provide personalized workout plans, and facilitate virtual group workouts. Integrating rewards and challenges would enhance motivation.
Time-Optimized Commute Planning:

Inconvenience: Daily commuters often face unpredictable traffic, leading to stress and wasted time.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Develop a mobile app that uses real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and user preferences to optimize commute routes. The app could provide alternative routes, suggest optimal departure times, and even facilitate carpooling options for a more efficient and stress-free daily commute.
Personalized Meal Planning for Dietary Goals:

Inconvenience: Planning meals that align with specific dietary goals or restrictions can be time-consuming and confusing.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Create a personalized meal planning platform that considers users' dietary preferences, health goals, and restrictions. The platform could leverage AI to suggest recipes, generate shopping lists, and provide nutritional information. Integration with grocery delivery services would offer a seamless experience.
Many of these are opportunities I've previously evaluated, however it is worth noting that ChatGPT seems to have a very consistent approach to generating it's entrepreneurial opportunities; I wonder if other students are getting similar responses?

The first opportunity, The automated shopping assistant, may be an idea already developed on by large grocers and department stores such as Walmart, Meijer, Target, or others. All of these companies have established apps availible for consumers to download, offering coupons, deals, store-wide news, and more. 

The second, a virtual fitness accountability program, lready exists in the form of countless fitness apps linked to different services. If anything, many high-end smart phones come pre-loaded with a fitness application of some sort. 

The third, time-optimized commute planning, is already a default feature in nearly every modern 'maps' app. Google Maps, Apple Maps, most map services already take into account weather, traffic congestion, route distances, and more to give an accurate prediction of the time it will take to reach a destination. 

The last, personalized meal planning, is once again an idea already previously evaluated. Included in the response this time, however, is the potential use of AI in the meal planning app or service, which would only benefit the idea given the self-learning nature of the technology. The more a user uses the app or service, the more it could learn about the users dietary specifications. ",,,,,,,,Are there different prompts that would provide different opportunities that you haven't seen before?,,,
LM,1,Spring,AI,10,"The prompt I used in ChatGPT was, what are 4 problems or opportunities that a normal 
person would notice and how would an entrepreneur solve the problem in detail?
Ranking Best to Worst: 
1. Communication Barriers:
a. Problem: Language barriers and communication difficulties can hinder effective 
interaction, especially in diverse environments.
b. Solution: Developing a translation app or communication platform with real-time 
language translation features can help bridge communication gaps. Machine 
learning algorithms and natural language processing can aid in providing accurate 
and contextually relevant translations.
2. Traffic Congestion:
a. Problem: Traffic congestion is a common issue in urban areas, leading to wasted 
time, increased fuel consumption, and environmental pollution.
b. Solution: Develop a smart traffic management system using AI and IoT 
technology. Implement real-time traffic monitoring, predictive analytics, and 
smart signaling to optimize traffic flow. This could include a mobile app for users 
to plan routes, receive live traffic updates, and choose the most efficient paths.
3. Regulatory Challenges:
a. Problem: Navigating complex and evolving regulatory landscapes can pose a 
significant hurdle.
b. Solution: Entrepreneurs should stay informed about industry regulations, seek 
legal advice, and proactively comply with relevant laws. Building relationships 
with regulatory authorities and industry associations can provide insights and 
support. Establishing robust internal compliance processes is essential for long-
term sustainability.

4. Market Saturation:
a. Problem: The market is saturated with similar products or services, making it 
difficult for a new entrant to stand out.
b. Solution: Differentiation is key. Entrepreneurs can focus on unique selling 
propositions (USPs), such as superior quality, innovative features, or exceptional 
customer service. Conducting thorough market research to identify gaps and 
niches can also help tailor offerings to meet specific needs.
Out of the 4 solutions I think that solution 1 because there is an increase in spoken languages 
other than English in the United States, maybe the world, and this could cause problems between 
customers and a service. A real-time and accurate in-ear translation app would be very useful in 
immediate situations where it is needed.",,,,,,,,Good. I would invite you to begin to assess if the opportunity is right for you due to your skils or connections. ,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,10,"âGenerate 4 different solutions to everyday 
problems in detail. How will the solution work and how will it be implementedâ
1. Smart Grocery Shopping Assistant:
Problem: Difficulty in keeping track of grocery lists and managing shopping efficiently.
Solution: Develop a mobile app that acts as a smart grocery shopping assistant. Users can 
create and manage their grocery lists, and the app will provide features like barcode scanning, 
recipe integration, and personalized recommendations. It will also optimize the shopping route 
within the store to save time.
Implementation: The app can be developed for both iOS and Android platforms. It will require 
integration with grocery store databases for real-time availability and pricing information. 
Machine learning algorithms can be used to provide personalized recommendations based on 
user preferences and past purchases.
2. Virtual Fitness Trainer:
Problem: Lack of motivation and guidance for staying fit and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Solution: Create a virtual fitness trainer that offers personalized workout plans, tracks progress, 
and provides real-time feedback and motivation.
Implementation: The virtual fitness trainer can be a mobile app or a web-based platform. It will 
require a user profile setup to understand individual fitness goals, preferences, and any existing 
health conditions. The app can leverage computer vision technology to analyze user 
movements during workouts and provide feedback. It can also integrate with wearable devices 
to track heart rate, steps, and other fitness metrics.
3. Intelligent Home Energy Management System:
Problem: High energy consumption and lack of awareness about energy-saving opportunities at
home.
Solution: Develop an intelligent home energy management system that optimizes energy usage,
identifies energy-saving opportunities, and provides real-time insights to homeowners.
Implementation: The system can consist of smart energy meters, sensors, and a central control 
hub. Machine learning algorithms can analyze energy consumption patterns and provide 
recommendations for optimizing usage. The system can also integrate with smart home devices
to automatically adjust energy usage based on occupancy and user preferences.

4. Personalized Learning Platform for Students:
Problem: One-size-fits-all approach in traditional education systems, which may not cater to 
individual learning needs.
Solution: Build a personalized learning platform that adapts to each student's learning style, 
pace, and interests.
Implementation: The platform can be a web-based application accessible on computers and 
tablets. It will require an initial assessment to understand the student's learning preferences and
strengths. Machine learning algorithms can then generate personalized learning paths, 
recommend relevant resources, and provide interactive exercises and assessments. The 
platform can also incorporate features like progress tracking and feedback mechanisms.",,,,,,,,So what did you think of the ideas? The point is to give you direct practice in evaluating ideas and not just becoming familiar with ChatGPT. You can email me an updated version with your assessments for full points,,,
KS,1,Spring,AI,10,"Prompt: Give me 4 business opportunities and how the solution would work
AI-Powered Customer Support Automation:
Solution: Develop an AI-driven customer support automation system that enhances efficiency and 
responsiveness in handling customer queries.
How it works: Implement chatbots and virtual assistants powered by natural language processing to 
handle routine customer inquiries. Integrate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve 
responses based on customer interactions.
My assessment: This business opportunity is already being implemented into business calls and customer 
service calls. I think this is a great opportunity to further improve and invest because customer service is 
not the most exciting and can be rather annoying for people. Using AI could cut back wait times and 
improve customer satisfaction. 
E-commerce Platform for Sustainable Products:
Solution: Launch an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling sustainable and eco-friendly products.
How it works: Curate a marketplace featuring products with environmentally friendly materials and 
ethical production practices. Partner with eco-conscious brands and highlight the sustainability credentials
of each product. Differentiate the platform as a go-to destination for conscious consumers.
My assessment: This is a decent business opportunity because of the growth of sustainable products. I 
find they are kind of hard to find and sometimes I donât know where to shop for sustainable products. 
This way all these products are in one place, and it makes it way easier for the customer to find the 
products they want. 
Green Transportation Solutions:
Solution: Launch a business that provides sustainable transportation options, such as electric bikes, 
scooters, or car-sharing services with electric vehicles.
How it works: Establish a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles, deploy them strategically in urban areas, and 
develop a user-friendly app for rentals. Promote environmental awareness and offer affordable, 
convenient, and green transportation alternatives.
My assessment: I think the idea of an only eco-friendly car company or style/model is a good idea, and I 
think has been explored before by car companies. The only aspect I think that wouldnât be a good 
business opportunity would be the rental aspect of this idea. I donât think it would bring in a lot of money 
and may hurt the company spending money on developing and keeping up with an app. 
Augmented Reality (AR) in Retail:
Solution: Integrate augmented reality technology into the retail experience, allowing customers to 
virtually try on products or visualize how furniture and other items would look in their homes.
How it works: Develop an AR app that uses the camera on a user's device to overlay virtual images of 
products onto the real-world environment. This enhances the online shopping experience, reduces return 
rates, and increases customer satisfaction.

My assessment: I think this is a great business opportunity, especially in something like retail. It hasnât 
been done before and is something I think people would be satisfied with. It would help shoppers shop 
faster and more efficiently. 
I would consider AI in retail to be innovative. Things similar have been used in the furniture industry but 
not in retail. I think it would better shoppersâ experiences and could incline people to buy more, which 
would help businesses out greatly. It allows for easier shopping and gives people a personal shopping 
experience as well, especially since online shopping isnât very personalized. ",,,,,,,,Good evaluations. What kind of prompts could you use to come up with more unique responses?,,,

For someone who prefers to do both, you could create a track in the gear system that could allow you to switch from one control to another. Currently you can only chose one and not other other. You would have to take apart the entire bike or buy another one all together. The average rider would be interested in purchasing these because many riders could have an all-in-one motororycle.

HM,1,Spring,Observation,11,"Heated Snow Scraper for Vehiclesâ. Does your vehicle not heat up quick enough to melt
the ice off of your windshield? A battery powered, much like a heated seat, snow scraper 
could be invented to remedy this issue. Many people own snow scrapers and use them in 
time of need. However, ice is usually the first thing to adhere to the windshield and then 
the snow. This requires heat and a scraping tool, but a car takes too much time. A heated 
scraping tool could speed up this process. It could also be used to remove the ice and 
snow build up in the wheel wells. So, what if this product was out on the market? 

Companies such as car washes, Menards, Home Depot, dealerships, etc. â vehicle related 
companies, would be able to sell this product. This product would not only help with the 
removal of ice, but it would also be less harmful on the human body. My father 
religiously cleans snow and ice off of our vehicles, but he unfortunately has arthritis. This
makes it more difficult for him to scrape the ice off the windshields. A heated scraper

if there was a product out there that kept your shoes tied? Some flexible material that 
binds your tied shoelace and keeps it in place. It would be in the form of a clasp. It would
be easy to apply, simply widen the clasp and attach to the knot of the tie. This would hold

cleanings (my dadâs insurance). Dental school is very expensive, time-consuming, and 
hard. You receive the title of doctor which requires a lot of hard work and expertise â so

2. âA College Must-Need Listâ. Upon my packing to Central Michigan University, I wish I 
had a list of what I should and shouldnât bring. I also wish that I knew exact room 
dimension, bed and desk measurements, and optional placements. If I was able to know 
this beforehand, everything would have been much smoother. I had unnecessary items 
and I needed items as well. It was a mess to say the least. The university should have a set
list with these things and have them emailed to each student two weeks prior to move in. 
ChatGPT provides a you-do (as in, you create the list) list of necessary items rather than 
the university providing one. Even though this might have been a helpful thing, the 

college should still send out what was mentioned. ChatGPTâs idea did not serve well to 
the idea that I had in mind. I do not think this is anywhere near unique. 
3. âWater and Weather Resistant Backpackâ. During college, you spend a lot of time 
walking in all kinds of weather â rain or shine. However, there is always a worry of your 
laptop and notes getting water and or weather damage. What if there was a backpack that 
was weather and water resistant? ChatGPT states that there are already some out on the 
market. A list of important factors is given. A few of these factors to keep an eye out for 
are material, sealed zippers, waterproof lining, and reinforced stitching. Also, popular 
brands such as North Face and Patagonia sell weather and water-resistant backpacks. I do
like that ChatGPT provided the factors to keep an eye out for when looking for the 
specifics. It also provided brands. I believe that ChatGPT gave good details of what I was
expecting. However, I would not agree that this is a potential opportunity since it is 
already a product on the market. I do believe that they could be made more durable and 
water-resistant though. 
4. âWall Poster Durabilityâ. I have this issue with wall posters â they rip very easily due to 
tape (even though itâs really weak tape). I would like these posters to be universally 
durable. As in, they donât rip from the weakest tapes, get dented less easily, etc. ChatGPT
states that âthe durability of wall posters depends on various factorsâ. A list of 
âconsiderations for ensuring the durability of wall postersâ is given. A few of these points
are paper quality, lamination, cleaning, careful handling, avoiding direct sunlight, etc. If 
youâre like me, a college student, cleaning a poster is not really an option. Also, you have
to repeatedly move the poster throughout time and handle it in various ways. 
Additionally, it is most likely in the sunlight due to there only being one window. A 

universal durable poster paper needs to be manufactured. I do not need a list of what 
ChatGPT supplied me. The potential opportunity is really not provided here.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
AM,0,Spring,AI,13,"Prompt Used: 

Please generate four separate scenarios centered around a common inconvenience or unmet need that people may face throughout their day-to-day life. With these scenarios, give an example of a possible invention or service that could improve the situation. Go in-depth on how they would be implemented.

Response Given:

Scenario 1: Desk Organization Dilemma Inconvenience: Cluttered and disorganized desks lead to difficulty in finding essential items, impacting productivity. Solution: Smart Desk Organizer Description: A smart desk organizer with RFID technology assigns digital tags to items like pens, notebooks, and gadgets. The organizer syncs with a mobile app, allowing users to locate items in real-time. The app also suggests optimal organization based on usage patterns and notifies users if they forget to place an item back in its designated spot.

Scenario 2: Grocery Shopping Nutrition Guide Inconvenience: Shoppers often struggle to make healthy choices at the grocery store due to the overwhelming variety of products. Solution: Augmented Reality Grocery Assistant Description: An augmented reality (AR) app for smartphones allows users to scan products with their cameras. The app overlays nutritional information, including calories, ingredients, and health ratings, directly onto the products in real-time. This assists shoppers in making informed decisions about their purchases and promotes healthier choices.

Scenario 3: Posture Improvement Wearable Inconvenience: Prolonged periods of sitting lead to poor posture, causing discomfort and long-term health issues. Solution: Posture-Enhancing Wearable Description: A wearable device, worn discreetly on the body, monitors posture using sensors and provides real-time feedback. When the device detects poor posture, it gently vibrates or sends a notification to remind the user to sit or stand correctly. Over time, the device adapts its reminders based on the user's habits, promoting better posture and reducing the risk of musculoskeletal issues.

Scenario 4: Language Barrier in Social Settings Inconvenience: Language differences hinder effective communication in social gatherings or international events. Solution: Real-time Multilingual Translation Earpiece Description: A small, wireless earpiece equipped with real-time translation technology translates spoken words into the user's preferred language. Users can participate in conversations seamlessly, regardless of the languages spoken. The earpiece connects to a mobile app for customization and supports a wide range of languages, fostering inclusive and barrier-free communication.





So once again, ChatGPT has given us a set of ideas, some of which are more original than others. I've tried tweaking my prompt, asking for more specific scenarios, but only got repeats of ideas i've already seen, but slightly modified. 

The first idea, a desk organization system, may be useful to some, but is overcomplicated beyond real practicality. Having every single object on your desk tagged with an RFID chip and connected to your phone is an impractical way to dodge your own organizational issues. The only possibly clever part of this idea is the ability for the app to suggest optimal organization layouts for your items based on the frequency of usage.

The second idea is a mobile phone app which uses augmented reality technology to overlay nutritional information, such as calorie count, ingredients, and more onto the product itself. This idea is completely unnecessary, as all of the information listed already legally has to be labeled on the packaging. This idea would only have a chance of working in a world where consumers are not given any nutritional information on the products they buy. 

The third idea, a posture improvement wearable, is closer to the type of idea I was looking for with the changes done to my prompts. While products meant to improve posture already exist, a less rigid brace that instead vibrates to gently remind users, rather than a net of straps and bars to keep good posture, sounds much more comfortable and natural. Out of the ideas provided by ChatGPT this time, this seems to be the most promising for further development. 

Lastly, ChatGPT suggested a real time translator meant to close the language barrier between speakers. This is a highly innovative idea, but many tech companies have already been developing this technology with steady success. While online or digital translation services have existed for the past 25 years or so, it is still just slow enough to not count as âreal timeâ. I predict in the next year or two we will have access to truly real-time translation.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
LM,1,Spring,AI,13,"The prompt I used in ChatGPT was, what are 4 opportunities that a normal person would notice 
and how would an entrepreneur solve the problem in detail?
Ranking Best to Worst:
1. Health and Fitness:
a. Opportunity: With a growing awareness of health and wellness, people may 
struggle to find convenient and personalized fitness solutions.
b. Solution: A fitness app could be created that offers personalized workout plans, 
nutrition guidance, and virtual coaching. This solution leverages technology to 
make health and fitness more accessible and tailored to individual needs.
2. Elderly Care and Companionship:
a. Opportunity: As populations age, there is a growing need for services that provide 
companionship and assistance to elderly individuals.
b. Solution: A service that connects trained caregivers or companions with elderly 
individuals who may require assistance with daily activities is a good solution. 
This service could improve the quality of life for seniors while offering peace of 
mind to their families.
3. Sustainable Fashion
a. Opportunity: With a growing emphasis on sustainability, there is a demand for 
environmentally friendly and ethically produced fashion products.

b. Solution: A thoughtful solution would be a sustainable fashion brand that uses 
eco-friendly materials, embraces fair labor practices, and promotes recycling or 
upcycling. This addresses the consumer demand for ethical and environmentally 
conscious choices in the fashion industry.
4. Remote Team Building
a. Opportunity: With the prevalence of remote work, companies may face challenges 
in fostering team collaboration and building a sense of camaraderie among remote 
employees.
b. Solution: An entrepreneur could develop virtual team-building solutions, such as 
online games, activities, and platforms that facilitate virtual team bonding 
experiences. This helps companies maintain a positive work culture and enhance 
team collaboration in the remote work environment.
Out of the 4 solutions I think that solution 2 is creative and unique because it is similar to what is 
out there now; however, recognizing that elderly individuals have diverse needs, the solution is 
designed to provide assistance with daily activities, but it also emphasizes the value of 
companionship. This reflects a nuanced understanding of the needs of the aging population, 
going beyond traditional caregiving services.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,13,"The phrase I plugged in is to âcreate four solutions to everyday problems that people go through 
to see if there is something already out there like what it is. Use the alertness rubric associated 
with the assignment as a guide. Which, if any, would you consider unique or innovative, why or 
why not?â
1. A mirror that uses face recognition and unlocks to give you reminders about things that 
you want to get done with for that day. It will also give you weather updates and other 
information so you can get ready to leave the house and know what you need to get done.
It is more efficient and an easier way to be ready when you leave the house.
2. Although using Chat GPT to do all your work isnât acceptable it is a great source to break
down complex information and explain it. A new model would be beneficial for students 
who are trying to study and want to understand concepts from their upcoming exams on a
deeper level. It will provide a study buddy type of aid. AI tutoring apps exist, but a 
comprehensive virtual study buddy with personalized study plans could offer a more 
holistic solution.
3. The creation of a community-based safety network app is the recommended solution, 
which aims to provide users with up-to-date information on area safety issues. The app's 
unique strategy is demonstrated by its focus on accurate information and cooperation 
with local governments. The app lets locals provide and get alerts for emergencies, 
crimes, and accidents through using location-based services and user-generated 
information. A coordinated and quick response might be made possible by the system's 
effortless interaction with local law enforcement, which would increase efficiency. 
Although there are other community safety apps available, this one stands out for 
improving safety in the neighborhood.
4. The suggested solution offers a smartphone app designed to help consumers keep an eye 
on the freshness of their groceries. The main function of the app lets users scan the 
barcodes of things they've bought, sending alerts when the products are about to expire. 
In order to access product details and expiration dates, implementation makes use of 
database integration and barcode scanning technologies. Users can also easily tailor the 
notification settings to suit their own tastes.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,

Prompts: Give me business opportunities and how they would work in the retail industry
Give me business opportunities and how they would work in the food industry
Personalized Shopping Experiences:
Idea: Implementing AI-driven technology to create personalized shopping experiences for customers.
How it Works: Utilize customer data and AI algorithms to analyze preferences, purchase history, and 
behavior. Provide personalized recommendations, discounts, and promotions through online and in-store 
channels. This enhances customer engagement and increases sales.
My assessment: I think this is a good opportunity, although I feel like this is already being implemented in
online shopping. The algorithm plays a huge role in the online world already so I am not sure how a 
business opportunity focused on these algorithms would do since they kind of already exist. 
Data-Driven Inventory Management:
Idea: Utilize advanced data analytics and machine learning for efficient inventory management.
How it Works: Implement a system that analyzes sales data, seasonality, and trends to optimize inventory 
levels. This minimizes overstock or stockouts, reducing costs and improving overall efficiency. The 
system can also automate reorder processes based on predictive analytics.
My assessment: I think this is a great business opportunity. Technology can play a big role in inventory 
like helping the workers in these stores reduce inventory mistakes and stress. This will bring in a much 
more efficient way of doing inventory. 
Ethnic or Specialty Food Experiences:
Idea: Create a business specializing in providing unique ethnic or specialty food experiences.
How it Works: Offer curated dining experiences or meal kits that showcase specific cuisines or rare 
ingredients. Collaborate with local chefs or culinary experts to provide an authentic and exclusive 
experience. This model appeals to food enthusiasts looking for something beyond mainstream options.
My assessment: I think this is a great business opportunity because being able to get specialized food or 
international food in stores or online is kind of difficult because there is no specific place to get them. So 
being able to create meal kits and experiences centered around special food or ethnicities could draw a lot
of customers. As well as supporting local businesses. 
Virtual Cooking Classes:
Idea: Offer virtual cooking classes where customers can learn to cook various cuisines from the comfort 
of their homes.
How it Works: Provide live or pre-recorded cooking classes led by professional chefs. Sell class packages,
ingredients, and cooking equipment through an online platform. This business taps into the growing 
interest in home cooking and the desire for unique culinary experiences.
My assessment: I do not think this is a good business opportunity because it has been done so many times
before. Also, there is a big platform called YouTube for people to create many videos of their interests and

the cooking community is strong there. So, I do not think selling cooking classes would bring in profit 
because it already exists on free platforms like YouTube. 
I would consider the ethnic or specialty food experience unique because things like meal kits have been 
done before but not really with special food. So, adding that aspect I think would bring in a whole new set
of customers.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
MC,0,Spring,Reflection,14,"Return on Investment- Brian Brasch

First i think what i noticed is he says you have to be willing to take a risk first and like in stores i think it is huge for companies to put a label on their products so consumers know what they are buying and what they can get out of it. At stores he believes companies do very well like starbucks and how their machines in the store are made for efficiency. If you are willing to spend more to help customers then you have to make sure that it is also worth it for the customers",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
BG,1,Spring,Reflection,14,"This week has proven to be slightly tougher than last week, although not in the sense that I am not noticing things, just that I am trying not to re-use ideas or complete anything too similar to something already in use. I feel like this week I had some interesting opportunties and solutions that I otherwise would never have thought about if it weren't for intentionally looking for them. Today as I was watching the Detroit Lions game, someone I was around started talking about how something on the football field with the team members was upsetting them. My initial instict was to ask ""how would make it better'? We spoke about a product, that I will present tomorrow, that could help the players and the coaching staff in real time. The mindset is easier to be in naturally, but the creativity seems to be where I am beginning to fall short.

I listened to the Opportunties Processing episode with Adam Kasilkowski and one of the big takeaways I had from this was the talk about having excitement about what you're creating or building. If you're not excited or do not have passion about your product or service, is it going to be as good? Are you going to work as hard to complete it? Adam had always been a car enthusiast and has a passion for the auto community. Once he determined a need, he already knew the avenues he could take to see it come to light. When you're assessing opportunities, you have to ask yourself ""is this something I want to put my own time into?"" ",,,,,,,,Great takeaway that is key to developing your evaluation abilities!,,,
HM,1,Spring,Reflection,14,"Reflecting on the past two weeks, I have been able to take my blinders off. In any room 
or location, I am able to see opportunities. This re-training of my brain has been progressive for 
me personally. There are a lot of different aspects of my life that others arenât able to experience 
(for example, being able to work with horses and livestock). Being able to dream up an idea or 
solution comes easier to me now than it did two weeks ago. However, I do have a hard time 
describing the idea/solution with accurate detail. Details such as how itâs made, who pays for it, 
and who invests in it. I have general thoughts of these, but nothing specific. Something else that I
could explore, that I learned from the podcast, would be how Brian Brasch mentions the 
importance of the value of the customer (their happiness) and return on investment (ROI). 
From the podcast, Brian Brasch detailed many things. One thing that really stood out to 
me was the return on investment, so, the customers happiness. These two things go hand in hand.
If customers continue to purchase a product, they are obviously happy with it, and Brasch 
receives a ROI. This is something that I would definitely want to explore in the future. Not only 
do I want to explore this more, I want to be able to become better at this also. Being able to view 
the potential of an opportunity is easy, but the decision to go through with a high-ranking 
potential opportunity is not. I tend to second-guess myself and, therefore, have a difficult time 
making certain important decisions. Brasch demonstrates that he has a much easier time with 
these decisions that I do.",,,,,,,,Great progress and analysis. You'll get the practice with the who and how they pay for it this week.,,,
AM,0,Spring,Reflection,14,"This week I listened to the podcast episode on opportunity processing featuring Adam Kaslikowski. In the episode, there was an emphasis on the idea of determining an ideas feasability. Kaslikowski explained his thought process on what variables needs to be considered before an idea is further developed into reality, such as potential costs, potential gains, or the practicality of the idea and the target audience for it as well. To draw connections between this way of thinking with my own, i've had to consider many of the ideas/opportunities suggested by ChatGPT and determine if they could be realistically developed or not. While ChatGPT's responses have been varied as far as the quality of ideas go, I see this as a learning opportunity for me to help train my eye for 'better' ideas. ",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
LM,1,Spring,Reflection,14,"Last week I compared and contrasted the way that Brian Gramm and I thought with 
problems, however this week I will relate my thinking to how Brian Brasch thinks. In the first 
minute of the podcast Mr. Brasch says he sees a need then realizes there is a demand for that 
thing and then creates a market for the need. What feels difficult to me that comes easy to Mr. 
Brasch is being able to see a need and coming up with a profitable solution. Coming up with a 
solution takes me hours and lots of help from those around me. Iâm hoping to integrate looking at 
a specific market that would be willing to buy my solution or product, so I can get the habit of 
next weekâs practice down easier and faster. 
While I still am struggling to get into the mindset of an entrepreneur, listening to the 
entrepreneurs from the podcast make it easier because they were normal people who didnât
always look for a product market. The hardest part of noticing opportunities is finding a 
profitable market if I come up with a solution. When I think of a solution, itâs typically 
something that would only be a one-time thing that would benefit me. I wouldnât say that I have 
made any connections from the practicing or podcasts to my life or other education.",,,,,,,,Great compare and contrast but don't forget to give yourself credit from where you started to where you are now. Skill development is incremental and you're doing great. Keep it up.,,,
AP,0,Spring,Reflection,14,"After listening to another 20 minutes of the Return on Investment podcast with Brian 
Brasch there were a few things that stood out to me. As a person who wants to start a business 
and create a new experience that people havenât had before. I found it interesting but logical 
when Brian mentioned a sample size of 200 people when trying out new products and getting 
feedback. The most important thing when creating a new service or product is understanding 
what the customer wants even if it is something different from your original thought process or 
ideas. By communicating with a larger size of possible customers you can really understand what
tweaks and adjustments you need to make to please their needs and create the biggest profit 
margin. This got me thinking, how can I incorporate this into a gym and training facility 
standpoint. I can ask people what they want to be added or changed to their experiences with 
previous gym memberships. This way I can base how to set up my gym, what special features 
and equipment I should have, and how I should base personal training sessions off of what the 
customer wants. 
Lastly, Brian mentioned a friend who is in the bar industry and created a jello shot 
machine that can create alcoholic treats in minutes. While brainstorming this, I assume that the 
owner didnât take into consideration that hospitals would be interested in using his invention to 
give out medicine to patients who canât consume it in liquid form. This taught me to keep an 
open mind and think how your ideas can be used in situations you arenât intending them for. That
is what I am going to take forward into the upcoming week while brainstorming ideas.",,,,,,,,"Great actionable takeway to set your gym up for success in the future. Usually it isn't the first iteration that is the most innovative, it requires you to hold off on deciding what the solution.",,,
KS,1,Spring,Reflection,14,"I listened to the episode Return on Investment where Brian Brasch was interviewed. In the 
interview, Brian talked about how thinking about and coming up with a vision comes pretty 
naturally to him, and he notices opportunities pretty quickly and can pick up on ideas quickly. 
This aspect I do struggle with, and Iâve noticed it takes me a little while to come up with a 
tangible idea to turn into a business opportunity. He demonstrated the way he comes up with 
ideas quickly and how he kind of is able to come up with his ideas which will be helpful for me 
in seeking out opportunities. Taking this away from this interview will help me be able to seek 
out an opportunity quickly and efficiently and not be hesitant and unconfident.",,,,,,,,None submitted,,,
BG,1,Spring,Observation,15,"While we were watching the football game yesterday, our friends starts talking about how he wishes there were senors in the helmets and pads of player to be able to see how hard a player gets hit. I started thinking about how interesting that would be and how potentially benefitial that could be to the NFL or other professional sports teams. Players could study their impact statistics and average areas they are hit per game, cross referenced to the players who hit them and get a better idea of who the ""heavy hitters"" are in a a game. Sure, we can see with our own eyes. But to see the statistic right in front of you I am sure could open up a world of information. It could always help with PT. You could target areas that were hit with greater force to help heal and better prepare for future games. These sensors would be manufactured by some sort of engineering company and most likely sponsored by an althetics company like addidas or whomever makes the helmets/pads.

It is such a simple update for such a high tech field. If you are paying apple for subcriptions, why not put those all in one place so you can review, cancel or adjust those subcriptions? This would be included in the apple product price they sell already, but could be advertised as a new feature, thus creating more sales through it.

if there was a brand out there that sold an extra set of soles along with the purchase of a 
pair of shoes? Glue would also be sold along with it. You would be able to detach the 
used sole and apply the new one with glue and then, a like-new shoe is reborn. This is 
aimed towards tenne-shoes. The company Redwings does something similar. They take in
the old shoe and detach the sole and sew a new sole on. These are for more of a boot type

I think pet owners would leap at the chance to have a smart pet feeder. You could program in the age, breed and weight of your pet. From there the smart feeder would be customizable based on your budget for food. 
Create a new product for people who have trouble sleeping.
Introducing ""DreamEase Sleep Companion,"" a comprehensive product designed to provide a holistic and personalized approach to improving sleep for individuals facing sleep challenges. 
Benefits:

Personalized sleep insights for targeted improvement.
Gradual and natural transitions into sleep and wakefulness.
Customizable sleep environment for optimal comfort.
AI-guided sleep coaching for sustainable lifestyle changes.
Enhanced overall sleep quality and well-being.
The DreamEase Sleep Companion is designed to address the diverse factors influencing sleep and empower individuals to take control of their sleep routines. Please note that this is a conceptual product, and actual development would require collaboration with sleep experts, technologists, and design specialists.

In this case I think the effort is worth more than the product is worth. There are many products that track sleep cycles with apple watches and aura rings. the AI-guided sleep coaching though is something I would like to take an interest into. What could AI do to help sleep coaching? Could an AI platform be created that doubles as a sleep study?",,,,,,,,"Nice assessments. I invite you to start evaluating if the outputs are a good opportunity for you because of your passions, interests, skills, or network.",,,

1. âCat Grooming: Universal Aggression Level Sheetâ. Has a cat ever scratched or bit you? 
Itâs uncomfortable, worrying, and harmful. Groomers should provide their customer a 
universal sheet that has each category of the groom (bathing, nail clipping, drying, 
trimming) and a scale of aggression. This is to ensure the groomerâs safety as well as the 
cats. The owner should be responsible for their pet when setting up an appointment with a
groomer. ChatGPT states that this can be a useful tool for cat groomers and owners. âThis
sheet can help in assessing and communicating a catâs aggression level during grooming 
sessionsâ â ChatGPT. A template is then given. This is a very useful tool and is needed 
amongst the grooming world. This could be changed for other animals as well. ChatGPT 
does a good job when generating this solution. This is what I was looking for when I 
applied this prompt into the search bar. I believe that this solution is innovative because 
you want to prepare for safety at all angles whenever possible. 
2. âWrapping Paper: Buy in Bulk â Get A Fitted Cutterâ. When buying wrapping paper for 
the holidays, itâs cheaper to buy in bulk. However, a lot of wrapping paper gets wasted 
due to not being able to cut it properly (I am a victim). If a bulk supply of wrapping paper
is being purchased, a fitted cutter should be provided as well â as a complementary item. 
ChatGPT does not provide an innovative or unique solution. It states that buying in bulk 
is a cheaper option, but then it lists supplies, variety, etc. Essentially, just tips to âbetterâ 
your next purchase. The fitted cutter idea is just another set of tips when purchasing. This
is not what I was looking for at all. I was hoping for a âpackageâ type thing where you 
buy in bulk and receive a cutter. The potential opportunity here is not worthy. This is not 
something that should be invested in. 
3. âPens: Get Multiple Ink Cartridges with Your Purchaseâ. Do you have a favorite pen? Do
you run out of ink and then have to buy another pen? This is annoying if you ask me. 
What if two or three ink cartridges were supplies in the packaging when purchasing your 
pen? These would be provided in the package with the pen. ChatGPT, again, provides a 
list of tips to make your pen usage easier. So, nothing worth considering. âCompare 
Prices, Brand Promotions, Pen Modelsâ â ChatGPT. What is provided by ChatGPT is 
essentially useless for this prompt. I am not looking for a list of tips and tricks to better 
my pen usage, I wanted a set idea for packaging of a pen and multiple cartridges. What 
was provided is not something I would consider an opportunity or unique. The potential 
is very minimal. 
4. âNew Stove: Recipe Sheet for Cooking with Your New Ovenâ. Do you have trouble 
finding something to eat for dinner seven nights a week? What if your stove came with a 
recipe book? This idea is already being used for other appliances such as blenders and 
bread makers. Why not stoves? ChatGPT provides a way that you can write down your 
own recipes. A template of organization of how to write down your own recipes. I was 
looking for a real recipe book provided by the stove company or a partnering one. I did 
not need to know how to write down my own recipes. The potential opportunity is not 
applicable due to not providing what I was looking for. From ChatGPTâs solution, this is 
not innovative.",,,,,,,,Nice work!,,,
AM,0,Spring,AI,17,"Try and generate four separate entrepreneurial opportunities through common inconveniences or problems people may face throughout their day to day life.
ChatGPT Response:

Automated Grocery Shopping Assistant:

Inconvenience: Many people struggle with finding time for grocery shopping amid busy schedules.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Develop a mobile app that utilizes AI to create automated grocery shopping lists based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and past purchases. The app could also partner with local grocery stores for seamless online ordering and delivery.
Virtual Fitness Accountability Platform:

Inconvenience: Maintaining a regular fitness routine can be challenging without proper accountability and motivation.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Create a virtual fitness platform that connects individuals with similar fitness goals. The platform could use AI to track users' progress, provide personalized workout plans, and facilitate virtual group workouts. Integrating rewards and challenges would enhance motivation.
Time-Optimized Commute Planning:

Inconvenience: Daily commuters often face unpredictable traffic, leading to stress and wasted time.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Develop a mobile app that uses real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and user preferences to optimize commute routes. The app could provide alternative routes, suggest optimal departure times, and even facilitate carpooling options for a more efficient and stress-free daily commute.
Personalized Meal Planning for Dietary Goals:

Inconvenience: Planning meals that align with specific dietary goals or restrictions can be time-consuming and confusing.
Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Create a personalized meal planning platform that considers users' dietary preferences, health goals, and restrictions. The platform could leverage AI to suggest recipes, generate shopping lists, and provide nutritional information. Integration with grocery delivery services would offer a seamless experience.
Many of these are opportunities I've previously evaluated, however it is worth noting that ChatGPT seems to have a very consistent approach to generating it's entrepreneurial opportunities; I wonder if other students are getting similar responses?

The first opportunity, The automated shopping assistant, may be an idea already developed on by large grocers and department stores such as Walmart, Meijer, Target, or others. All of these companies have established apps availible for consumers to download, offering coupons, deals, store-wide news, and more. 

The second, a virtual fitness accountability program, lready exists in the form of countless fitness apps linked to different services. If anything, many high-end smart phones come pre-loaded with a fitness application of some sort. 

The third, time-optimized commute planning, is already a default feature in nearly every modern 'maps' app. Google Maps, Apple Maps, most map services already take into account weather, traffic congestion, route distances, and more to give an accurate prediction of the time it will take to reach a destination. 

The last, personalized meal planning, is once again an idea already previously evaluated. Included in the response this time, however, is the potential use of AI in the meal planning app or service, which would only benefit the idea given the self-learning nature of the technology. The more a user uses the app or service, the more it could learn about the users dietary specifications. ",,,,,,,,Are there different prompts that would provide different opportunities that you haven't seen before?,,,
LM,1,Spring,AI,17,"The prompt I used in ChatGPT was, what are 4 problems or opportunities that a normal 
person would notice and how would an entrepreneur solve the problem in detail?
Ranking Best to Worst: 
1. Communication Barriers:
a. Problem: Language barriers and communication difficulties can hinder effective 
interaction, especially in diverse environments.
b. Solution: Developing a translation app or communication platform with real-time 
language translation features can help bridge communication gaps. Machine 
learning algorithms and natural language processing can aid in providing accurate 
and contextually relevant translations.
2. Traffic Congestion:
a. Problem: Traffic congestion is a common issue in urban areas, leading to wasted 
time, increased fuel consumption, and environmental pollution.
b. Solution: Develop a smart traffic management system using AI and IoT 
technology. Implement real-time traffic monitoring, predictive analytics, and 
smart signaling to optimize traffic flow. This could include a mobile app for users 
to plan routes, receive live traffic updates, and choose the most efficient paths.
3. Regulatory Challenges:
a. Problem: Navigating complex and evolving regulatory landscapes can pose a 
significant hurdle.
b. Solution: Entrepreneurs should stay informed about industry regulations, seek 
legal advice, and proactively comply with relevant laws. Building relationships 
with regulatory authorities and industry associations can provide insights and 
support. Establishing robust internal compliance processes is essential for long-
term sustainability.

4. Market Saturation:
a. Problem: The market is saturated with similar products or services, making it 
difficult for a new entrant to stand out.
b. Solution: Differentiation is key. Entrepreneurs can focus on unique selling 
propositions (USPs), such as superior quality, innovative features, or exceptional 
customer service. Conducting thorough market research to identify gaps and 
niches can also help tailor offerings to meet specific needs.
Out of the 4 solutions I think that solution 1 because there is an increase in spoken languages 
other than English in the United States, maybe the world, and this could cause problems between 
customers and a service. A real-time and accurate in-ear translation app would be very useful in 
immediate situations where it is needed.",,,,,,,,Good. I would invite you to begin to assess if the opportunity is right for you due to your skils or connections. ,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,17,"This is what I typed out and said into the chat GPT âGenerate 4 different solutions to everyday 
problems in detail. How will the solution work and how will it be implementedâ
1. Smart Grocery Shopping Assistant:
Problem: Difficulty in keeping track of grocery lists and managing shopping efficiently.
Solution: Develop a mobile app that acts as a smart grocery shopping assistant. Users can 
create and manage their grocery lists, and the app will provide features like barcode scanning, 
recipe integration, and personalized recommendations. It will also optimize the shopping route 
within the store to save time.
Implementation: The app can be developed for both iOS and Android platforms. It will require 
integration with grocery store databases for real-time availability and pricing information. 
Machine learning algorithms can be used to provide personalized recommendations based on 
user preferences and past purchases.
2. Virtual Fitness Trainer:
Problem: Lack of motivation and guidance for staying fit and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Solution: Create a virtual fitness trainer that offers personalized workout plans, tracks progress, 
and provides real-time feedback and motivation.
Implementation: The virtual fitness trainer can be a mobile app or a web-based platform. It will 
require a user profile setup to understand individual fitness goals, preferences, and any existing 
health conditions. The app can leverage computer vision technology to analyze user 
movements during workouts and provide feedback. It can also integrate with wearable devices 
to track heart rate, steps, and other fitness metrics.
3. Intelligent Home Energy Management System:
Problem: High energy consumption and lack of awareness about energy-saving opportunities at
home.
Solution: Develop an intelligent home energy management system that optimizes energy usage,
identifies energy-saving opportunities, and provides real-time insights to homeowners.
Implementation: The system can consist of smart energy meters, sensors, and a central control 
hub. Machine learning algorithms can analyze energy consumption patterns and provide 
recommendations for optimizing usage. The system can also integrate with smart home devices
to automatically adjust energy usage based on occupancy and user preferences.

4. Personalized Learning Platform for Students:
Problem: One-size-fits-all approach in traditional education systems, which may not cater to 
individual learning needs.
Solution: Build a personalized learning platform that adapts to each student's learning style, 
pace, and interests.
Implementation: The platform can be a web-based application accessible on computers and 
tablets. It will require an initial assessment to understand the student's learning preferences and
strengths. Machine learning algorithms can then generate personalized learning paths, 
recommend relevant resources, and provide interactive exercises and assessments. The 
platform can also incorporate features like progress tracking and feedback mechanisms.",,,,,,,,So what did you think of the ideas? The point is to give you direct practice in evaluating ideas and not just becoming familiar with ChatGPT. You can email me an updated version with your assessments for full points,,,
KS,1,Spring,AI,17,"
Prompt: Give me 4 business opportunities and how the solution would work
AI-Powered Customer Support Automation:
Solution: Develop an AI-driven customer support automation system that enhances efficiency and 
responsiveness in handling customer queries.
How it works: Implement chatbots and virtual assistants powered by natural language processing to 
handle routine customer inquiries. Integrate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve 
responses based on customer interactions.
My assessment: This business opportunity is already being implemented into business calls and customer 
service calls. I think this is a great opportunity to further improve and invest because customer service is 
not the most exciting and can be rather annoying for people. Using AI could cut back wait times and 
improve customer satisfaction. 
E-commerce Platform for Sustainable Products:
Solution: Launch an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling sustainable and eco-friendly products.
How it works: Curate a marketplace featuring products with environmentally friendly materials and 
ethical production practices. Partner with eco-conscious brands and highlight the sustainability credentials
of each product. Differentiate the platform as a go-to destination for conscious consumers.
My assessment: This is a decent business opportunity because of the growth of sustainable products. I 
find they are kind of hard to find and sometimes I donât know where to shop for sustainable products. 
This way all these products are in one place, and it makes it way easier for the customer to find the 
products they want. 
Green Transportation Solutions:
Solution: Launch a business that provides sustainable transportation options, such as electric bikes, 
scooters, or car-sharing services with electric vehicles.
How it works: Establish a fleet of eco-friendly vehicles, deploy them strategically in urban areas, and 
develop a user-friendly app for rentals. Promote environmental awareness and offer affordable, 
convenient, and green transportation alternatives.
My assessment: I think the idea of an only eco-friendly car company or style/model is a good idea, and I 
think has been explored before by car companies. The only aspect I think that wouldnât be a good 
business opportunity would be the rental aspect of this idea. I donât think it would bring in a lot of money 
and may hurt the company spending money on developing and keeping up with an app. 
Augmented Reality (AR) in Retail:
Solution: Integrate augmented reality technology into the retail experience, allowing customers to 
virtually try on products or visualize how furniture and other items would look in their homes.
How it works: Develop an AR app that uses the camera on a user's device to overlay virtual images of 
products onto the real-world environment. This enhances the online shopping experience, reduces return 
rates, and increases customer satisfaction.

My assessment: I think this is a great business opportunity, especially in something like retail. It hasnât 
been done before and is something I think people would be satisfied with. It would help shoppers shop 
faster and more efficiently. 
I would consider AI in retail to be innovative. Things similar have been used in the furniture industry but 
not in retail. I think it would better shoppersâ experiences and could incline people to buy more, which 
would help businesses out greatly. It allows for easier shopping and gives people a personal shopping 
experience as well, especially since online shopping isnât very personalized. ",,,,,,,,Good evaluations. What kind of prompts could you use to come up with more unique responses?,,,
BG,1,Spring,Observation,18," the problem is a subjective and biased problem. My very good friend does not like the show Friends. We often reference the show and her partner is one of the biggest fans I know. We regularly try to get our friend to watch Friends and she can never get into it. This product/solution stems from that. She said that Friends fans would buy anything if it referenced the show, which is quite percise. It is not necessarily a new product, but a Friends themed product. All of the fans know that one of the main characters, Joey, loves Pizza. He has the ""Joey Special"" which is ""two pizzas."" A line of frozen pizzas, that could come in a pack of, you guessed it, two. It would be marketed with the ""Joey Special"" and a friends themed packaging. Getting involved in the processed and freezer food industry is tough. You would have to do research about ingredients and how long they last frozen and experiment with the best way to re-heat the pizzas. They could be distributed through common grocery stores, and because it comes with two pizzas, even wholesale stores like Costco. My first step in creating this product would be doing research with local grocery stores to see how many frozen pizzas they sell on average. The product would have to be good or people wouldn't buy it again and retention when it comes to branded products like this is extremely important. ",,,,,,,,"Nice! Much richer ideas/solution descriptions. Another useful habit is to think about the deal killers for an idea and focus on that first. For example, as you noted the frozen pizza isn't a new thing-the new thing is the Friends' themed product. In order to beable to do the new thing all hinges on whether or not you can license the Friends' intellectual property to use in that way. So the first thing to research is who owns that and what it would take to get that exclusive right to use Joey's name and image.

BG,1,Spring,Observation,18,"When doing a knee surgery, my husband has said that over the last 1000 knee replacements he has done, he noticed the Tibia is aesymetric. The company he works for, only makes a symetric implant. He suggested that an aesymetric impant be designed. Creating an aesymetric tibial implant would provide more coverage on the tibia, which would result in more comofort and longevity in the product. Especially when younger and younger people are getting their knees replaced. The oldest person who my husband worked on today was 55. You would need to work with an engineer to create this product, it would have to be surgical grade and manufactured through a medically accredited company. There are companies that engineer their own implants. In addition to an engineer you would need to bring on a medical consultant to perform clinical trials, in order to ensure safety and desireablity. You would then sell the implants to surgeons and that is how the company would make money. This would require a large upfront investment, and years of trials to gain FDA approval. You would have to network in the surgical industry in order to obtain funding, but the return on investment would be great. At a wholesale price, one implant ranges from $1,000-$13,000 depending on the contracts with the hospitals. ",,,,,,,,"Nice! Much richer ideas/solution descriptions.

BG,1,Spring,Observation,18,"What if there was a way to make a HEPA approved filtered respirator that you can wear comfortably around your neck that isnt an uncomfortable and stiff mask? I interviewed one of my friends in the Tile and Stone indsutry, who owes his own local business. I started by asking him the emotional questions, what during your day upsets you? His answer was he often gets irritated with the resperator masks through the day because they are uncomfortable, so him and other people he works with just end up pulling their shirts over their faces. This is not a truly effective way to prevent inhaling dust when cutting tile, stone, drywall or anything that creates dust. I then asked him if he would wear a gator, like they make for cold weather, with a respirator, that you could comfortable wear around your neck when you are not cutting something, but is also easy to put up and is held up but your own body. It would be comfortable cotton or even a moisture wicking material. For myself to create this product I would first have to research HEPA regulations on filters. Then I would have to test the efficiency of the filter. Getting the material would prove to be the most simple as cotton material is mass produced over seas for a very reasonable price. There would be an engineering aspect to fit the resperator into the mask and keep it form fitting. You could use a dense foam mold or a cheaper plastic. This could be sold through E-commerce and through home improvement stores like Home Depot or Lowes. A regular resperator sells for about $30. People would pay for comfort, and you could collab with a bigger name brand like Carhart that already is established as a heavy duty appearel company to keep the product price competitive but also highly marketable.

HM,1,Spring,Observation,18,"âRepairing and Nourishing Mane & Tail Shampoo & Conditionerâ. Horseâs manes and 
tails have much thicker strands than human hair. However, these strands tend to become 
more brittle and break off very easily. Horses are constantly in the elements of weather 
and cannot avoid it. Protection for their hair is difficult to administer due to them not 
generally liking foreign objects on them. One of my horseâs wears a tail bag to protect her
tail, but she rips the tail bag off because she hates it. Following this, her tail becomes 
brittle, dry, and essentially just disgusting. What if there was a shampoo and conditioner 
for horses that repaired and nourished their damaged hair? Humans have these types of 
shampoos and conditioners, but what about horses? Many horse owners would love this 
product. Other pet owners might buy this product as well for dogs, cats, and other 
livestock. Each shampoo bottle would sell for about $40, and the conditioner bottles

ingredient. What if there was a prepackaged smoothie recipe? These packages would 

have various components in them with nutritional value. They would come in many 
flavors and some sizes (in ounces). These could be sold at grocery stores and gas stations.

After going home, I found more games that I didn't have use for, but couldn't check to see how much I could get in return unless I physically went back to the store and asked. A possible solution for this could be to offer a new service on the Gamestop website that could give accurate and consistent value estimates for unwanted video games.

These therapy masks used low wavelength light to reduce signs of aging and kill bacteria on the skin. What if you could combine the two items? Weaving the red/blue lights though the pillow allowing for that anti-aging and bacteria killing light to work while you sleep. These masks range from $30-$300. The pillow case would help you kill bacteria on your face but also on your pillow. This could go into having sheets with the lights, preventing dust mites and other bacteria in your sheets from your skin and clothes. First thing is getting light strips made that are donât generate too much heat so they are safe for use on the skin. They would have to be sealed in a water proof casing so they could be machine washable as well. The light could potentially bother some people while they sleep, so the product would come with a eye mask that is could help contribute to positive sleep. They could be affordable satin or more luxury silk, meeting multiple markets.",,,,,,,,"Nice, what would you pay for each of these?",,,
BG,1,Spring,Observation,19,"My husband and I have a lot of tattoos. It is a hobby of ours as we love to express ourselves with tattoos. Today, my husband got out late dogâs portrait tattooed on him. It is stunning just as she was. We are always looking for new tattoo artists around the area, but we have been tattooed all over the world. We are always looking for new cool designs and we love the style that corresponds with the tattoo community. The one thing that is difficult to keep up with is the new tattoo care items and unique styles that come out. There is an online magazine that is reputable called Inked Magazine but unless you are visiting tattoo shops regularly, you arenât really able to keep up on whatâs new. Something that has become increasingly common is subscription boxes. Just like skincare, makeup, even sock subscription boxes have been released, there could be a tattoo subscription box! It would include designs by artists from all over the world in different styles that you could customize to your liking, apparel, tattoo care product samples and digital content that includes Q&A about all things tattoos. You could feature new artists that are established or just trying to build their business. The revenue stream would primarily be the subscription fees, but you could also make money off the apparel sales and artist collabs.",,,,,,,,"Nice, what would you pay for each of these?",,,
HM,1,Spring,Observation,19,"âShoe Whitening Penâ. Most students, whether itâs college or high/middle school, wear 
white shoes. The fabric portion of the show can be bleached, but what about the rubber? 
For me, I constantly wear multiple pairs of Converse shoes that all have that outer rim of 
white rubber. Additionally, I ruin anything thatâs white or nice in record time. My 
Converse are the victim. A pen that has the ability to whiten and brighten the rubber 
portion of the shoe would be amazing! All you have to do is âdrawâ and press the pen 
(more like a felt tipped marker) onto the portion of rubber on the shoe that is dirty. Then, 
the pen would extract/dissipate the dirtiness and replace it with the brightening/whitening
ability. Many students would purchase this as well as athletes. Shoe collectors might also 
be willing to purchase this. This product would be priced at about twenty-five dollars. It 
would be the size of a regular Crayola marker. There are stain removing agents as well as 
whitening agents out there. The marker design itself is already out there also. Itâs just the 
act of fabricating this product.",,,,,,,,"Nice, what would you personally pay for these solutions?",,,
HM,1,Spring,Observation,19,"âStain Removing Wipes for Hair/Furâ. As someone who shows horses (and knows others 
as well and others who show livestock such as cows, sheep, goats, etc.) with white legs, I 
know the frustration of a horse getting itâs white dirty. The white areas of a horse or any 
other livestock is very difficult to keep that way. They like to poop, pee, get a grass stain, 

or any other possible kind of stain on the white specifically. There are stain removing and
whitening shampoos out there, but you canât rewash your livestock directly before a 
class. What if there were stain removing wipes that are safe for skin? These wipes would 
come in a packaging such as Lysol wipes. Local livestock stores and chain stores such as 
Tractor Supply would sell these. Many livestock owners who show their animals would 
purchase this product on the spot (I know I would). Also, parents might purchase this for 
their kids or pets. These wipes would be sold for forty dollars. Being able to create a stain
removing wipe that is safe for skin and hair is a great thing. Livestock owners or creators

formula.",,,,,,,,"Nice, what would you personally pay for these solutions?",,,

very versatile â as in, they have many purposes. But why canât wipes have calming scents
such as lavender, chamomile, etc.? These scented wipes would need to be skin safe also 
(like a baby wipe!). Like essential oil diffusers, these scented wipes could help calm you, 
your child/baby, or animal. For me, I use essential oils to help my horses stay calm. 
However, a scented wipe would be much more practical and easier to use. It is much 
harder to apply oil to a horseâs nose rather than a wipe. These wipes would not cost very 
much but would cost more than your average baby wipes. Each package would cost about
ten dollars. Parents and livestock/equine owners would pay for these wipes. Local 
livestock stores and chain stores such as Tractor Supply could sell these. Also, a booth at 
a livestock event (example: MSU livestock shows) could market this product. ",,,,,,,,"Nice, what would you personally pay for these solutions?",,,
AM,0,Spring,Observation,19,"While cooking some food, I was adding several different spices, seasonings, and salts to the mix. It was a bit difficult remembering exactly how much of the previous seasonings I had used, and how much more was necessary. A possible innovation in this situation could be a smart-spicer. It could be a can-sized gadget, with different slots for different spices. The user could easily choose proportions of spices in their mix, perhaps via a dial that changes the ratio of spices being dispensed. This would be a great invention for beginner chefs who may want to very precisely follow cook-book directions, as well as more seasoned chefs who want strict quantitative control of the spice content in their food.

The ability to heat food in mere seconds is great, but cooling food down still takes a while in the refrigerator/freezer. A solution to this problem could be a machine that rapidly drops the temperature of anything placed inside (essentially the opposite of a microwave). The machine would have to be built to endure rapid temperature changes, and should have non-stick surfaces that won't collect ice. This invention would certainly benefit any industry dealing with consumables, including packing plants, restaurants, or bars needing ice cold drinks. This machine could also benefit home chefs who want to work with frozen ingredients in new and more dynamic ways.

I actuall love this idea! You would have to be comitted to accept new appliances, like a french press or a perc. You could customize your subcription with items you already had, and get new components to those items. For example: if you already have an espresso machine, you could get new filters for that or items that make different types of espresso with directions and ingredients on how to create them. For example: a cuban coffee is usually used to a moka pot on the stove top with raw sugar. It would come with ingredients, origins, and the appliance.

This is SO interesting. Over the spring/summer I am always going up to Home Depot to get new stuff to help my lawn/yard. New blades for my mower, 2-cycle gas, new line for the weed whip and so on. I never thought to create a subcription service for this. Amazon has subcription options for certain products, but they don't tailor to your own yard. There would be a professional on the other end, almost like a pest control company does, that reviews your yard and gives you personal recommendations.

HM,1,Spring,AI,20,"ChatGPTâs Top Three Picks:
1. âCheaper Dental Workâ. 
- What ChatGPT states: âAffordable dental services are often in demand, and if you 
can provide cost-effective options without compromising quality, it could attract a 
significant audienceâ. 
- 
For this idea, I agree wholeheartedly with ChatGPT. This is a dream of mine to 
provide cheaper dental care with quality. However, ChatGPT isnât addressing what 
areas in America need cheaper dental care the most â so, location and demand. It also 
doesnât really go in depth at all about any aspects. It just provided an explanation as 
to why itâs a good idea. 
2. âMagnetic Power Stripâ. 

- What ChatGPT states: âA unique and practical solution for organizing and powering 
devices. This product may appeal to those looking for efficient ways to manage 
cables and devices in their workspaceâ. 
- 
For this idea, ChatGPT says that this is a good idea, I agree, but it doesnât address 
who would sell these and the pricing. However, it does address who would buy them 
and why. Although those are good points, I would have liked more information. 
3. âSmoothie Ingredients in A Packageâ. 
- What ChatGPT states: âConvenience is key for many consumers. Providing pre-
packaged smoothie ingredients could cater to individuals seeking a quick and healthy 
option for their busy lifestylesâ. 
- 
For this idea, ChatGPT addressed who would buy this product. It also gives an 
explanation as to why people would want to purchase this product. However, it does 
not give any pricing and where it could be sold at. I believe that this is a good idea, 
but I would have liked a little more information in order to really pursue this idea.",,,,,,,,Nicely done,,,
AM,0,Spring,AI,20,"The 10 ideas presented to ChatGPT (paraphrased):

Car song recognition feature

AI Car Maintenence assistant

Automated floor buffer

Emergency gas delivery service

Automatic grocery bagger 

Salad Vending machine

Heated coatrack 

Automatic instrument tuner

Self driving grocery scooter

Home trash compactor


ChatGPT's response: 


1. Smart Car Radio Song Identification:

Reasoning: This idea addresses a common frustration and enhances the in-car entertainment experience. The integration of a song identification feature in cars has the potential to attract music enthusiasts. Car manufacturers can leverage this as a unique selling point, catering to the growing demand for personalized and seamless in-car technology.
2. AI-Powered Car Maintenance System:

Reasoning: The complexity of car maintenance can be overwhelming for many users. Introducing an AI-powered system to diagnose issues and provide maintenance suggestions simplifies the process for car owners. This could lead to increased vehicle longevity and reduced maintenance costs, making it a practical and beneficial solution.
3. Automated Salad Vending Machine:

Reasoning: Automating the salad preparation process addresses common issues associated with traditional salad bars. The user-customizable interface and freshness control make it an appealing concept. This invention not only caters to those looking for a convenient and efficient meal option but also offers potential applications in various settings, such as workplaces or public spaces.
While all the ideas have merit, these three stand out due to their potential impact, feasibility, and uniqueness in addressing specific needs or inconveniences. Keep in mind that successful implementation would also depend on various factors such as market demand, technology readiness, and user acceptance.


ChatGPT gave some good feedback, and its important to note that two of the three ideas were car-related. This could be due to the car industry pushing for additional features and smarter technology. It does seem, however, that ChatGPT has an ironic bias towards ai-based ideas, as reflected in this response and many others throughout our conversations. I also like the fact that ChatGPT included a reminder after the list explaining that there are still many factors to consider, such as feasibility or market demand. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

1. Smart water bottle
2. Smart sleep system
3. Automated delivery service for medication
I do agree with ChatGPT because these are the solutions that have the biggest market and 
consumer base. The water bottle has those who frequent the gym or are forgetful. The smart 
sleep system has those who suffer from insomnia. The automated delivery for medication has the 
elder and also those who are forgetful or disabled. The only thing ChatGPT isnât addressing is 
what the current market looks like for similarly produced products.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
AP,0,Spring,AI,20,"Out of the ten proposals, the three best to pursue are:
Smart Home Energy Management System: This solution addresses the widespread 
problem of household energy usage inconsistency. It has a clear revenue model involving
direct sales to consumers and partnerships with utility companies, ensuring a steady 
stream of income. The potential market is significant, as both environmentally aware 
consumers and utility companies are interested in energy conservation.
Community Plastic Recycling Stations: This solution targets the problem of inefficient 
plastic waste recycling, offering a tangible and scalable approach to recycling. The 
revenue model involves partnerships with businesses and local communities, ensuring 
sustainability through contributions to logistics and coordination costs. With increasing 
awareness about environmental conservation, this solution has a growing market demand.
Virtual Mental Health Support Groups: Addressing the challenge of limited access to 
mental health resources, this solution provides a scalable and accessible approach to 
mental well-being. The revenue model includes subscription fees and 
corporate/institutional plans, ensuring profitability while providing valuable support to 
individuals and organizations. With the rising importance of mental health awareness, 
this solution has significant market potential.
After plugging in 10 of my proposal ideas Chat GPT chose these three. I do agree that these 
would be very good ideas to pursue because all three are different in their own way and provide 
unique solutions to problems that are serious issues but also relate to me and are important for 
me to pursue. If there is something I wouldâve liked chat Gpt to take into consideration it 
wouldâve been the revenue factor and how we would charge tp m,ake many and the specifics 
behind each price. I would also take that into consideration when making a decision.",,,,,,,,So which of these could you presonally make happen?,,,
KS,1,Spring,AI,20,"Based on what was put into ChatGPT, these are the top 3 choices out of my list of 10. 
High-Tech Sleep Earplugs:
Problem: Loud neighbors affecting sleep.
Solution: Create high-tech earplugs for sleeping.
Target Market: Headphone companies, audio technology companies (e.g., Sony, Apple).
Revenue Model: Production and sales through stores or online.
Shoe Attachment for Icy Sidewalks:
Problem: Icy sidewalks causing walking difficulties.
Solution: Gadget for shoes to clear ice/snow.
Target Market: Outdoor shoe companies (e.g., Timberland), outdoor stores (e.g., Lowes, Home Depot).

Pill Dispenser with Notifications:
Problem: Forgetting to take medication.
Solution: Pill dispenser with notifications.
Target Market: Elderly individuals, hospitals.
Revenue Model: Sales as an add-on accessory for medication management.
I agree with this top 3 choice. I think all the ideas are innovative and could bring in good business and 
revenue. They cover a range of issues and have potential markets. I donât think ChatGPT went into 
enough detail about each opportunity and why it was the best choice over others, but it still provided the 
information that I wanted.",,,,,,,,Which do you think you could execute personally?,,,
BG,1,Spring,Reflection,21,"Between what I have listened to in the podcasts, what you have encouraged us to realize in our assignment, and my actual application of these abilities, I would the developement is rough but on the same page. It all starts with indentifying a problem. Over the last three weeks, you have helped train my brain to notice the smaller things that happen throughout the day that could be helped. I started to notice how many times the people around me say "" I wish I had this "" or ""if only there was something"". I took this previously as compaints but in reality they are all opportunties. What worked well was coming up with thoughtful solutions to the problems and really thinking about what I would do to begin creating the product or solution. What avenues would I have take and what research would I have to complete to first begin? A small part of me always just assumed that these ideas came from someone who was immersed in the field already, which you stated, passion does help; but ideas can be formed from all sorts of things. Chat GPT was interesting. I think it has some okay ideas, but no matter how many times you ask it different questions it is very limited in idea. What I do think it was great for was structuring. If would give you a general structure for a business model to build off of. You could use it for things like marketing plans or additional research topics. AI is still so new but I do think it is the way of the future. 

This learning experience was unlike any I have ever had. I really enjoyed it! I think starting off with 5 was a little difficult, but that is just like learning any new way of thinking.

HM,1,Spring,Reflection,21,"When comparing my abilities to Brian Grammâs, I realized that they are similar. For 
instance, Gramm and I both can look at most things around us and come up with an idea 
(everything has potential). Also, we can look at anotherâs perspective and not just our own. 
Although there are some similarities, there are some differences as well. Gramm stated that it 
only takes him three to four seconds to wrap his head around the entire idea, but itâs not just the 
idea. Itâs also how itâs made, how itâs priced, who would buy it, and is it worth producing. An 
important point that he mentions is if heâll buy the product or not. If he has no need or want for 
it, then why put forth the effort? As previously mentioned, it only takes Gramm a few seconds to 
think of all of this while it takes me more than that. Based on these differences and similarities, I 
believe that I have definitely grown from this process, but there is always something to learn and 
progress at. 
Regarding the past three weeks, I believe that I have changed my perspective. Iâm able to 
look at something and see what can be improved on it. Iâm also able to see something from 
multiple perspectives rather than just my own. This process has allowed me to change my 
perspective on the world around me. As for my learning style, I learned that I am very adaptable 
(thankfully). Although I thought I did well with this process, I would prefer it to be a little less 
excessive (as in, maybe not on the weekends â I donât have internet at my house). However, I do
understand the importance of the repetition of this process. For the future, I will be utilizing this 
knowledge and applying to every aspect of my life â especially my future career as a business 
owner. The ChatGPT aspect of this process I did not like. I do not like AI in the slightest bit. 
However, I do understand the importance of why it was used â it cannot mimic the thoughts of a 
human. It is limited to what it can think and comprehend. Although it did provide some good 
points, I most likely would not use it again. 
 (The weekend assignments are excessive for me because I go home every weekend. I do not 
have internet at my house. Therefore, I have to drive twenty minutes to have internet and upload

AM,0,Spring,Reflection,21,"I listened to the first half of the podcast episode titled ""Return on Investment - Brian Brasch"" and drew heavy similarities to the idea-generating mindset of Brian Gramm in another episode ""Opportunity Identification"". These two both shared perspectives on how they seek unmet needs or problems in order to try and find innovative solutions, or in the case of Brasch, he seeked out solution ideas and determined their feasibility. I have also tried to maintain this way of thinking as the daily opportunity practice assignments have gone on, but found it surprisingly mentally exhausting. We live in a very convenient world where nearly every surface-level problem or inconvenience has some form of solution, and so trying to find the few-and-far-between inconveniences that were prominent enough to matter was a bit challenging. Even if it was over the course of a few weeks, coming up with 52 total original/semi-original ideas became progressively more difficult as the common and obvious answers were exhausted. Officially using ChatGPT as a partner and tool in assignments was a bit fascinating, as I haven't done that for a class before. There were times where ChatGPT gave genuinely good responses/feedback, and so I would say it was a great inclusion to the course so far. To address other points, ChatGPT was not perfect. The program regularly generated repeats of previous ideas, and had narrow visions with some underwhelming ideas at times. Another thing to consider is the goal of maintaining academic integrity, and I believe that if both the students and professors clearly communicate the designated uses and rules towards generative AI, it can be a great tool for both parties.",,,,,,,,Great analysis! Thanks for sticking with it.,,,
LM,1,Spring,Reflection,21,"For the last podcast, I decided to listen to the episode with Adam Kaslikowski. Something 
similar that Mr. Kaslikowski and I do is say âyes ifâ to ideas. I donât move forward with an idea 
if I canât get a satisfactory answer to the yes if. Compared to the 3 experienced entrepreneurs, I
would say that my developed ability to notice entrepreneurial opportunities is very weak and 
mediocre. These experienced entrepreneurs can see an opportunity to make a profit off of almost 
everything whereas I struggled to come up with a solution that would benefit more than just me. 
It was fun to try and get into an experienced entrepreneur mindset, but I think that I would have 
to have more unique problems, considering most of my solutions were already readily available 
items already on Amazon. 
Iâm more of a visual and hands-on learner so this was challenging to me. I donât think 
that this process changed me, however, that might not be the case from an outside perspective. I 
canât say exactly what worked well because trying to get into the entrepreneur mindset, while it 
as fun the couple of times it happened, was so much harder than I expected. I didnât notice the 
little things that could have easily been turned into a profit. I think I have a consumer mindset 
and not an entrepreneurial mindset. I think consuming is easier than creating. Having used 
ChatGPT before for dinner ideas, it was easy to use however, the trick is to be very specific with 
your requests. Going forward I donât plan on using ChatGPT for academics, while it might help 
create ideas, Iâm not willing to risk it when Iâm so close to graduating. The only thing I think 
would make the exercise better is a quick example of what a problem, need, and great experience 
are. Otherwise the 3 week exercise was very fun to do.",,,,,,,,Great suggestion for improvement. I'll be interested to see if you find yourself still noticing opportunities over the next couple of weeks even though there won't be any homework associated with it. Just the fact that you are aware that there is a consumer mindset is evidence of some growth.,,,
AP,0,Spring,Reflection,21,"
If I compared my skill to identify potential opportunities for an entrepreneurial idea 
compared to professional entrepreneurs, I think I've come a long way, but I still have an 
opportunity to grow. I've shown that I understand how to recognize issues, offer solutions, 
identify client groups, and recommend revenue models by utilizing the awareness rubric. But 
there's much more to learn about analyzing markets, evaluating risks, and creating thorough 
business plans. 
Overall, using ChatGPT has been a worthwhile experience. The ability to come up with 
ideas and offer direction has been very helpful. Its broad knowledge base, fast concept 
generation, and flexibility in responding to many prompts contribute to its advantages. A few 
drawbacks, nevertheless, are the occasional mistakes or irrelevant answers and the requirement 
for review to ensure academic honesty.
I propose adding more real-world case studies and hands-on activities to help students 
implement entrepreneurial ideas in the upcoming class. Improving the learning process could 
also involve offering advice and recommendations regarding suggested improvements. In 
addition, encouraging group brainstorming and idea improvement among students may promote 
deeper learning and creativity.",,,,,,,,Thanks for putting in the work to learn.,,,

MB,1,Fall,Observation,8," Today I was having coffee with a few of my friends, and we were 
talking about interviewing for businesses and how itâs probably just as difficult for businesses to learn 
and practice interviewing as it is for interviewees. Especially now with the minimal workforce, 
interviewers are under the same pressure to make an impression on their interviewee so that theyâll 
want to work for them. I thought of the concept of a âprofessional interviewee.â This could stem from 
the same company that businesses hire business consultants from. Businesses could hire a professional 
interviewee to come in a perform a mock interview with the business and evaluate certain aspects such 
as asking the right questions, showing off their business in an appealing light, etc. After businesses have 
worked with a professional interviewee, they will gain better skills for potential employees to want to 
work for them.",,,,,,,,Good work involving others in your idea generation. It also can help you see if you have any potential partners that might want to join you.

many preservatives and other unhealthy items into food as U.S. food manufacturers. My solution to this 
problem of âunhealthyâ food is to create a food company that follows the same food regulations as 
other countries so that people feel better after eating than how most U.S. companies leave them. 
Although it will likely cost more to produce these types of products resulting in them being more 
expensive, people will still buy this product because they will realize how much better they feel after 
consuming the food. This company could also help with part of the U.S.âs problem of a largely unhealthy 
and overweight population.",,,,,,,,Good work involving others in your idea generation. It also can help you see if you have any potential partners that might want to join you.

rents cars on a semester-by-semester basis at an affordable price for college students. So many college 
students canât have cars with them at college for multiple reasons including coming from a different 
state/ country or not being able to afford a car. This car rental service would solve those problems and

professors showing my concern for the semester because the class is based upon quizzes and 
exams. I showed my concern of unfairness because I think only having quizzes and exams 
frustrates students because some are not good test takers, like me for example. I had asked her to 
set up a WebEx meeting for the best way to discuss the best way to perform well in her class. 
She responded that if I did not like how the material was set up for the course, that I was able to 
drop it. I did not like this response because my needs were not met being a student. I just wanted 
to discuss better ways and opportunities to discuss how I could perform well on the exam. I 
understand that my point may have come across as rude, but it was not my intention. The

MD,1,Fall,Observation,8,"The first experience that I thought of for this assignment involved my commute to work yesterday. For context, I have a weekend job back in my hometown and there is a lot of construction there all of the time. I left early this morning so that I could get a coffee before work since I would be there for a while, and felt good because it seemed like I had more than enough time to get my coffee and make it to work before my shift started. Unfortunately, when I was almost to work, I saw that there was construction on the one road I needed to take to make it there! This construction didnât show up on Google Maps or Apple Maps, and my coworkers said that it likely wasnât on the apps because it was fairly unexpected. This made me and the people I spoke to feel frustrated because it impacted our commute to work but there was no way to know about it until it had already affected the route. This got me thinking that maybe there is a solution that involves a technology that could partner with a Maps app to give timely and accurate updates on things like construction so that you will always feel confident that your commute will go as expected. I believe that this would be effective because it could be built into your preexisting Maps app so that you donât have to leave your GPS to see the real time construction updates. This would help drivers to feel more confident that their directions will be accurate, instead of worrying that they will run into unforeseen construction when theyâre already stressed about getting to work on time.

Right now I use color coded highlighters to mark my due dates / plans for each but it would be nice if there were sectioned off places to make everything look a bit more put together.

MD,1,Fall,Observation,8,"For my third experience today, I thought about how procrastination is a big issue with a lot of the population and myself at times! I have recently seen some apps that do a nice job of helping people get past their procrastination in a cute and helpful way. For example, there is an app that lets you water a virtual plant each time you get one of your set tasks done. I saw that and thought that this was a great idea, but realized that it may be even more effective with some more personalization. I think that a great way to help people get their tasks done is to incorporate a pet for example, as opposed to a plant. Personally, I think that the plant idea is cute, but I donât mind disappointing a plant. I would, however, mind disappointing my own pet that I created in virtual form. I think that it would be cool if when you signed into the app you created either a pet modeled after your own pet, a replica of a childhood stuffed animal or even just your favorite animal to help you with your procrastination. Every time you get a task done you could give your pet a treat. I know that this would make it more likely that I would visit the app, and it would just be so uplifting to see my pet happy instead of a random plant.

JH,1,Fall,Observation,8,"Research Methods Study Sessions â Today in my psychology research methods class, we struggled to 
find a time where the entire class could meet for a study session for our next exam. It was frustrating to 
everyone because nobody wanted to miss the study session and end up doing worse on the exam. I 
started wondering about if there was a way to possibly organize a type of app or website to let students 
and teachers organize study groups or multiple study sessions that people could sign up for and get 
reminders beforehand. This would be convenient for everybody to be more well informed on study 
sessions, and there would be a great audience for it because there are students like me who typically

of in person interviews. She had said everybody hired from that group of people were also excellent

setting up virtual or entirely not in person interviews so candidates with social anxiety may work on 
answers at their own pace instead of enduring the stress of an in-person interview, and perhaps not

AT,1,Fall,Observation,8,"Getting carsick; motion sickness
a. Yesterday we went out of town and drove about an hour and a half both ways. We drove with our neighbors in their car which meant we sat in the backseat. That in combination with the twisting roads made me feel sick to my  stomach and nauseous. Even today, I am still feeling a bit queasy. I do get car sick easily but it was worse in this particular situation because we were riding in our friendsâ car and I was nervous to get sick; especially because I  wasnât in my own car and couldnât get comfortable. Overall, it felt very uncomfortable and I am still feeling the effects today which is pretty inconvenient. 
b. I know that there are already products aimed towards preventing or relieving motion sickness like medicine and patches that can be worn under your ear. Unfortunately for me, I didnât have either, which was my own fault. I  didnât have the time beforehand to purchase either. I had also thought I would be okay without it. My unique solution is motion sickness prevention sunglasses. I will never forget my sunglasses no matter where I go. I always have  a pair of sunglasses in my purse, in my car, etc.. Oftentimes I wear a pair on my head, and carry another pair in my bag. Living in California, there is always sunshine and I guess my eyes are sensitive to the light. I think most people  tend to wear sunglasses in the car, when theyâre driving and/or riding. If a lens could be created to solve motion sickness, I think a lot of people would be interested. Itâs an alternative to taking a pill which can be difficult for some  people. Others might prefer not to take pills and might prefer a more natural alternative. In addition, motion sickness patches have a very strong smell and I think that it might turn a lot of people off from them. Motion sickness  preventing sunglasses is a much less invasive alternative, while also being a unique concept. The only change in behavior that this product would require is maybe remembering to carry the sunglasses and wear them too. Itâs  possible some people might dislike wearing sunglasses, or they might forget them easily.",,,,,,,,Great work!

AT,1,Fall,Observation,8,"Painted pottery being minorly damaged during glazing and firing
a. We just picked up our pottery pieces that we had painted, today. Overall, they turned out well but Iâm starting to notice a pattern. The last couple times Iâve painted pottery, Iâve gotten it back and there are small chips in the   paint. Iâm assuming this is from the ceramic touching the kiln after glazing, maybe even debris that dug into it. I am definitely a perfectionist which makes it frustrating and kind of irritating when something like this happens  after working hard on a piece.
b. For this specific problem, I would design a glazing and firing tool in one. If the act of glazing and firing could be done in the same place, this would limit the amount of times a piece would have to be held and moved. As of  right now, pottery studios hand dip pieces in a vessel of glaze then they move them to the kiln where they sit next to multiple other pieces to be fired. Because the demand is usually very high, most studios most likely put the  freshly glazed piece directly in the kiln, without waiting for it to dry. My product would involve a tray where the painted pieces would sit. Then, a glaze that has been turned from liquid to gas would be sprayed on to the  contents inside. After the allotted time, then the kiln would begin to fire the pieces until they are completely finished and ready to be picked up by customers. This particular product would be popular amongst studio owners  and that is most likely it. This isnât the type of product that would be easily purchased and used by one person in their home. This could potentially be a disadvantage. It also would depend on the cost to make the product. If it  is expensive and sells for a price that is too high, itâs most likely that small studio owners wouldnât purchase it either. ",,,,,,,,Great work!

AT,1,Fall,Observation,8,"Locating a specific movie or show on one of the various streaming platforms
a. This is a (minor) problem that is so common. Everyone that I talk to has said the same. My mom was trying to locate a specific Halloween movie today that we had both seen streaming previously. However, between the both  of us, we have over five accounts for streaming services. Every streaming service has a different selection and usually no movie can be found on multiple websites. For example, âPrincess and the Frogâ can only be found on  Disney+. The Harry Potter series is only on MAX-previously HBO Max. You canât watch Harry Potter on Amazon Prime Video or on Starz. Thereâs really no solution to this problem which means in order to find something specific,  you have to scroll and search through each platform until you find it. Itâs a huge time waster and it can also be frustrating. 
b. My solution to this problem would be an application and search engine that can be used or  downloaded. The user can search the name of the show or movie that they are looking for and then there would be populated results telling the user where it  can be found and watched. I think I would also add the feature of  telling the user if itâs offered free with subscription to the streaming service, and/or the cost to rent/purchase. The results of the search could also provide a direct link to that streaming service and movie. Personally, I like the idea  of a service like this one. I would definitely use it. However, it makes me think of the two families I babysit for who have Apple Tvâs. Their Apple Tv remotes give them the option of searching through typing or speaking and then it  finds the show/movie for you, without having to go to specific apps and search. For people with Apple Tvâs, this service most likely would not be needed. Most people I know donât have Apple Tvs so it makes me think this would  still be a popular service. If people who do have Apple Tvs were to watch something on their phone, computer, or tablet then I think theyâd still get use out of it.",,,,,,,,Great work!

AT,1,Fall,Observation,8,"Carved pumpkins growing mold after only a couple of days
a. My husband and I just carved a pumpkin the other day and we had to throw it away today because it had grown a ton of mold. We were talking about this and how common it is, with the family I babysit for, at a birthday  party. The last time I carved a pumpkin was when I was a kid with my parents and I do not remember the pumpkins rotting so soon. Iâm not sure if itâs California pumpkins or the climate here that makes this happen. Itâs  possible itâs also my nostalgic brain remembering things differently. 
b. This fall, Target has actually come out with fake pumpkins that can be carved. They are like any other plastic, fake pumpkin that you can buy. But, you can carve it and it never goes bad. You can even save it from year to year. I  think this was a very creative idea that has a lot of benefits! That being said, the pumpkins still donât carve like your normal pumpkin. You are limited to the design. In addition, I personally enjoy carving a real pumpkin and saving  the seeds to bake and eat later. My solution is a spray that stops the growth of bacteria and mold, making the pumpkin last longer. The formula would be a substance like vinegar or bleach, a bacteria fighting agent. Possibly  additional ingredients that serve as pumpkin food that keep the pumpkin healthy and âalive.â I would partner with a local farmer, specifically one who has experience growing pumpkins. Then, I would conduct research to see  which products would be most beneficial. I have never seen a product like this offered so it would be very unique.

on the owner of said dogs. There currently is nothing like this available so this product wouldnât

tracking but it only shows where they were last used which isnt helpful when you cant find the

MD,1,Fall,Observation,9,"For todayâs assignment I decided to focus on some potential solutions for problems within the videography community. I have been involved with video editing for around ten years now, but am fairly new to shooting. Being introduced to shooting events has shed light on how difficult it can be at times to be in this industry. The first thing that I thought of was how the majority of videographers have a hard time staying up to date with new technology as itâs coming out. This can be really frustrating because you may have only had your camera for a year and a half before itâs considered to be dated. It just seems like there is always an endless amount of new equipment to buy, and itâs all extremely expensive! I thought that a possible solution to this issue would be to be able to rent out new equipment to use for specific products that you may need to shoot a specific event (example: drone). This would help people out because they have a reliable place to rent out equipment from, and by renting they would pay a fraction of the price and still be able to use the equipment for that event!",,,,,,,,"Well done! Transaction details would need to be worked out but you could do the first two together. You may want to study things like airbnb or other rental/share business models. But you need to also consider how it can be different from sharegrid.com, borrowlenses.com, or lensrentals.com.

Seasonality and fluctuations in market demand are a challenge for many, many industries. Cash flow becomes so important. Many smaller business owners have learned to find other businesses that have an opposite seasoonality.",,,
MD,1,Fall,Observation,9,"The second problem I thought of ties in really well to my first scenario. Due to the fact that videographers have to buy new equipment all the time, lots of them have a lot of extra equipment that they donât currently use laying around. I think that it would be cool to be able to use my first business opportunity to let videographers actually rent out their old equipment. In my opinion, this would be better than simply selling the equipment because you would be able to get money every time someone uses it instead of one upfront price. Also you would be helping out others in the community, which could help build connections, especially for new videographers. This would help out those that use the service because one person is able to make money on their equipment that they arenât currently using, and one person is able to rent the equipment for an affordable price to shoot their desired event. Everyone wins!",,,,,,,,"Well done! Transaction details would need to be worked out but you could do the first two together.

MD,1,Fall,Observation,9,"The third problem that I thought of within the videography community is inconsistency in jobs during the off season. I am currently experiencing the tragedies of the winter time, because I was really busy in the summer, and now I am not busy at all! This can be frustrating and saddening for photographers and videographers because especially when youâre new and you start booking all these jobs in the summer, it can be disheartening or even anxiety-inducing to suddenly have no jobs for months. I think that one way to make the winter time a bit more relaxing would be to create a budgeting platform that you can customize to your own needs in a way. It would be effective to be able to set money to automatically transfer to a separate account to hold until the winter time. For example, if it was me, I would probably set it to automatically take 200 dollars out of every check that I get for a job in the summer. That way, I will have a bit of money every job going towards my emergency fund for the winter. I think that a lot of people would enjoy this, and it would help the slow season be less stressful.

MD,1,Fall,Observation,9,"Lastly, I thought back to my first time creating a contract. It was difficult because legal stuff is sometimes nerve-wracking and you wanna make sure to protect yourself fully for when you film events. The solution that I thought about for this was being able to sell contract templates for videographers so that they can fill in their own information and have all of the necessary protections in place. This would help take some of the stress off of new people in the industry, because they donât feel like they have to act as a lawyer. Thereâs a lot of little things to worry about when youâre starting a business, so being able to make one thing easier would be good!",,,,,,,,"Well done!

JH,1,Fall,Observation,9," Various Laundry Tips â Growing up, I feel like I did not have a ton of laundry education as it feels like 
thatâs the chore I always left to my older siblings. For me, this mostly pertains on how to clean off certain
stains off of clothes as I noticed today while trying to take a ketchup stain off of my shirt. It is a 
frustrating problem as sometimes I do not know how to deal with certain situations and it is somewhat 
embarrassing. I have noticed that other college adults rarely have knowledge of laundry as well because 
thereâs usual little laundry etiquette such as cleaning out the lint tray which is frustrating in itself. I feel 
like some sort of chart or gag book could be made from this idea to poke fun at the lack of knowledge 
but also still provide helpful info for unaware students such as myself. ",,,,,,,,"Good descriptions that convey emotional evidence. How much would you pay for these solutions? Which ones do you think you've got the skills or connections to make yourself?

AT,1,Fall,Observation,9,"Alcohol based markers drying out
a. 
I just purchased a set of alcohol based markers off Amazon, which are definitely
not cheap. I got them because Iâve recently been really into coloring as a
de-stressor and I love watching coloring videos. Thereâs a specific brand of
coloring books that a local girl in San Diego designs and sells. They are very
popular on Tik Tok and everyone uses alcohol based markers when coloring the
pages. Long story short, I purchased a coloring book and wanted the markers as
well. I havenât even finished half of the book and some of the colors are already
drying out which makes me super sad because theyâre colors I use frequently. As I
mentioned, they are also expensive. I am frustrated that this is happening,
especially because itâs not super easy to just buy that specific color. Iâm sure I
could if I wanted to put in the time and the research, but I prefer not to because
this is just a recent hobby of mine.
b. My solution is a product that is a pot of a liquid substance that draws alcohol to
the surface and therefore brings pigment back into the color, when dipped. To put
it a bit more clearly, Iâm thinking of a pot of nail polish remover that you dip your
finger into, in between sponges, and it removes the polish. A design like that, but
the sponges inside are not soaked in nail polish remover of course. Instead, when
you dip the brush of your marker, the liquid is drawn to the tip and the pigment is
restored. I think that artists and people who enjoy making art as a hobby would be
inclined to purchase a product like this. It is unique because thereâs nothing like it
for alcohol based markers. It would be a product that is pretty cheap to make
which means it would be affordable for consumers.",,,,,,,,Great work!! Who else might benefit from those kinds of inventions? How much would you pay for your ideas?,,,

a. Pretty much every single day I take myself to Starbucks, which is a truly awful
habit. I know several people who also go to Starbucks daily and we have agreed
that itâs because it never tastes as good when we make it at home. Personally, Iâve

tried many different recipes and I even got an espresso machine. No matter what
Iâve tried itâs just not worth the effort and it hardly ever tastes good.

b. My solution is an all in one espresso machine. It brews espresso, makes foam, and
mixes a drink to your preference. There would be a screen where you would
select your drink: latte, cappuccino, etc.. From there, you would select your
modifications: syrups, flavoring, sweeteners, number of shots of espresso, etc..
Then youâd press the âstartâ button and the machine would brew and create your
drink. This would be a luxury experience, as is a trip to Starbucks. Many people
are driven towards buying their coffee because of the experience: getting dressed,
getting in the car, etc.. With this machine, you can create a luxury experience at
home. In addition, you donât have to worry about mixing things correctly or
following a recipe. There is really no room for error. The machine will make your
drink precisely how you want it. I do believe that this is an entirely unique
product and experience. I also think that so many people would want to purchase
it and use it in their homes or work spaces. Although it would be more expensive
to purchase up front, eventually you would save money. It would also be much
more convenient because you could press start while youâre getting ready for

I broken it. Especially because itâs one of the Starbucks You Are Here mugs that
you can really only get at that specific location, unless you want to pay exorbitant

broken piece(s). The company would then recycle the glassware and possibly use
it to make new pieces. The stock that customers can choose from would be an
assortment of pieces, mostly vintage and thrifted. But theyâd be unique pieces that
were sourced and given new lives and homes. This is in an effort to also reduce
the effects of over consumption and ensure that proper recycling and reusing is
taking place. Environmentally friendly practices would be at the forefront of this
businessâ ideals. Stock that is available to purchase could also come from local
artisans all over the world, giving them access to larger markets, and using fair
trade practices. I might decide to also include old pieces that people donât want
anymore, even if they arenât broken. Then, one personâs trash is another personâs
treasure. I think this is a unique idea. I believe there are similar companies that do 
this for clothing and/or designer accessories. However, Iâve never seen this done
with homeware/dishware. In this day and age I think many people are driven by
their environmental concerns. They tend to prefer companies and businesses that
enforce environmentally safe practices and ideals. Overall, it would be a relatively
simple process too. It would just require packaging old dishware and dropping it
off at a post office.",,,,,,,,Great work!! Who else might benefit from those kinds of inventions? How much would you pay for your ideas?,,,
AT,1,Fall,Observation,9,"Never knowing when cookies are done baking in the oven
a. When Iâm baking cookies I prefer for them to be soft and golden instead of
crunchy. I usually take cookies out of the oven earlier than the timer goes off, yet
they always end up a bit too âburntâ for my preferences. I havenât been able to
find the fine line between raw and undercooked and burnt and crunchy. Every
recipe is different so of course that makes it difficult, and I know for a fact that
the pan plays a big part too. Is it dark? Is it light? Does it need to be oiled? Etc..
Today, I made my last batch of Halloween cookies and unfortunately they came
out a little too overcooked. I was somewhat disappointed knowing I wouldnât be
able to enjoy them, and I didnât feel confident enough to share with our neighbor
friends. I knew my husband would eat them but surely not the entire batch, so I
also felt wasteful. I feel like this is probably a common issue amongst amateur
bakers like myself who just want/need to bake some cookies! Something that
should be simple.
b. My solution to this problem is a cookie sheet that detects the temperature of the
cookies in the oven and changes color depending on it. Eventually there would be
a product line to follow that would consist of different bakeware and cookware
that does the same. On each product there would be a little gauge and it would
start on yellow for cold and not cooked. Then orange could follow and then red
which would mean that whatever is on the sheet is fully cooked. Iâm thinking
there would be two different cookie sheets. The first one would be for people who
prefer their cookies soft and without crunch. When the gauge on this cookie sheet
turns red, the cookies are cooked but not overcooked to the point where they are
crunchy. The second cookie sheet would be the same but for people who like a
crunchier cookie. At first it might be difficult for behaviors to adapt to this
product (line) since Iâm sure most people prefer multitasking and wait to hear a
timer go off. It might be difficult at first to remember to keep checking the gauge,
but that is why this product is designed for cookies that donât take longer than
10-15 minutes to bake. I think this is a unique idea as Iâve never heard of anything
like this. I would purchase this product and I think that others would be inclined
to do so as well.",,,,,,,,Great work!! Who else might benefit from those kinds of inventions? How much would you pay for your ideas?,,,

with time management like myself. It can be hard to juggle a full time job while being a

combat this common issue among students colleges and universities should start

experience are never open late enough for some late nights making it more tempting to

sign up to be DD, or designated drivers on certain days of the week. CMU has similar
programs but they are for mental health and for victims of sexual assault. However with
the DUIâs of college students not getting any better any time soon, having a program that

MB,1,Fall,AI,10,"Opportunity #1: Is creating a clothing brand that reuses old clothes a good business idea?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a clothing brand that reuses old clothes can be a viable and socially 
responsible business idea, particularly in the context of increasing awareness of environmental 
sustainability and the need for more circular economies. This type of business aligns with the 
principles of ethical and sustainable fashion, catering to a growing consumer demand for 
environmentally friendly products and practices. Here are some key points to consider when 
evaluating the viability of this business idea:
â¢ Unique Value Proposition: Define a unique value proposition that sets your clothing 
brand apart from competitors. Highlight the environmental benefits of reusing old 
clothes, emphasize the quality and design of your upcycled products, and communicate 
your brand's commitment to sustainability.
â¢ Market Demand: Conduct thorough market research to assess the demand for sustainable 
fashion products in your target market. Identify consumer preferences, purchasing 
behaviors, and trends related to sustainable clothing to ensure there is a viable customer 
base for your upcycled products.
â¢ 
Supply Chain and Sourcing: Develop a reliable supply chain for sourcing old clothes and 
materials for upcycling. Establish partnerships with thrift stores, recycling centers, and 
clothing donation programs to secure a consistent and diverse supply of used garments 
that can be repurposed into new, fashionable items.
â¢ 
Product Design and Quality: Focus on creating innovative and stylish designs that appeal 
to your target audience while maintaining high-quality standards. Ensure that the 
upcycled garments are durable, comfortable, and visually appealing to attract and retain 
customers.
â¢ Marketing and Branding: Develop a compelling brand story that emphasizes your 
commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. Utilize digital marketing 
strategies, social media platforms, and content marketing to raise awareness about your 
brand and educate consumers about the environmental benefits of choosing upcycled 
clothing.
â¢ 
Pricing and Profitability: Set competitive pricing that reflects the value of your upcycled 
products while remaining attractive to your target market. Conduct a thorough cost 
analysis to ensure that your pricing strategy allows for sustainable profit margins while 
considering the costs associated with sourcing, production, and marketing.
â¢ Regulations and Compliance: Familiarize yourself with relevant regulations and 
compliance standards related to the clothing industry, including product labeling, 
environmental certifications, and labor practices. Adhering to ethical and legal guidelines 
will enhance your brand's credibility and trustworthiness.
By addressing these factors, you can develop a solid foundation for your clothing brand and 
position your business as a pioneer in sustainable fashion, contributing to the reduction of textile 
waste and promoting a more eco-friendly approach to clothing production and consumption.

Assessment: I liked ChatGPTâs input on this business idea especially about regulations and 
compliance because this would help my business to become more legitimate in the clothing 
industry including getting environmental certifications. I researched a few environmental 
certifications I could get as a clothing company and one I saw that I would likely want to earn for 
my business is Bluesignâone of the highest standards in the clothing industry for sustainability. 
If I were to consider this as a legitimate business, I would want to find a person more involved in 
the clothing industry to consult. This does not seem as good as an option as other business ideas 
for me personally due to my limited background in fashion and the clothing industry.
Opportunity #2: Is creating an online platform that helps exchange items among college students 
a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating an online platform that facilitates the exchange of items among 
college students can indeed present a promising business opportunity, particularly if it addresses 
a genuine need and offers a user-friendly and secure platform. Here are some key factors to 
consider when evaluating the potential of this business idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Conduct thorough market research to understand the specific needs and 
challenges of college students regarding the exchange of items. Identify common pain 
points, such as the need for affordable textbooks, furniture, electronics, and other 
essential items, to ensure that there is a significant demand for your platform's services.
â¢ User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive and user-friendly online platform that 
enables easy item listings, searches, and secure transactions. Implement features such as 
user profiles, item categories, messaging systems, and payment gateways to enhance the 
overall user experience and encourage active participation.
â¢ 
Security and Trust: Establish robust security measures to safeguard user data, protect 
against fraudulent activities, and ensure the trustworthiness of all transactions. Implement 
user verification processes, secure payment gateways, and moderation systems to create a 
safe and reliable environment for students to exchange items.
â¢ Marketing and User Acquisition: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to 
promote your platform to college students, leveraging social media, campus events, and 
targeted advertising to increase user engagement and attract a significant user base. 
Consider partnering with student organizations and campus authorities to enhance 
visibility and credibility among the student community.
â¢ Monetization Strategies: Explore various monetization strategies, such as transaction 
fees, premium memberships, and targeted advertising, to generate revenue from your 
online platform. Ensure that your monetization model aligns with the preferences and 
financial capabilities of college students while providing value-added services that 
encourage user participation.
â¢ 
Scalability and Expansion: Plan for scalability and potential expansion by continuously 
enhancing the platform's features, addressing user feedback, and considering 
opportunities to broaden your target market beyond individual college campuses. Explore 

partnerships with universities, educational institutions, and student organizations to 
facilitate broader adoption and expansion.
â¢ Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Familiarize yourself with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements, including data protection, consumer protection, and online 
marketplace regulations, to ensure compliance with the law and avoid potential legal 
complications or liabilities.
By addressing these critical aspects, you can establish a successful online platform that caters to 
the specific needs of college students and fosters a vibrant community for item exchange, 
thereby creating a valuable and sustainable business opportunity.
Assessment: I enjoyed reading all ChatGPTâs insights especially on how I would make money 
for my business. I considered many options including the ones that ChatGPT offered. I would 
likely make money by charging an exchange fee or a listing fee of $0.20 per or so. This is a good 
business opportunity, and I would consider exploring this business opportunity because it doesnât 
seem as difficult to implement because it doesnât use a certain type of expertise.
Opportunity #3: Would creating a business that focuses on helping people keep up with their 
mental, social, and physical health be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a business that focuses on helping people maintain their mental, 
social, and physical well-being can indeed present a compelling business opportunity, especially 
given the growing emphasis on holistic health and wellness. The demand for services and 
products that promote overall well-being has been increasing, making this an opportune time to 
consider entering the market. Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating this 
business idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Conduct thorough market research to identify the specific needs and 
preferences of your target audience in terms of mental, social, and physical health. 
Understand the challenges they face and the existing gaps in the market to tailor your 
offerings accordingly.
â¢ Holistic Approach: Develop a comprehensive and holistic approach that integrates mental 
health services, social connection initiatives, and personalized fitness programs to cater to 
the diverse needs of your clientele. Emphasize the importance of a balanced lifestyle and 
promote the interconnectedness of mental, social, and physical well-being.
â¢ Expertise and Partnerships: Build a team of qualified professionals and experts in various 
fields, including mental health counseling, social support, and fitness training, to provide 
comprehensive and high-quality services to your clients. Establish partnerships with 
reputable health professionals, fitness instructors, and community organizations to 
enhance your business's credibility and expertise.
â¢ Technology Integration: Leverage technology to offer convenient and accessible 
solutions for your clients, such as online counseling sessions, virtual fitness classes, and 
community engagement platforms. Invest in user-friendly apps, wearable devices, and 
digital tools that can help individuals track their progress and stay connected with your 
services.

â¢ 
Personalization and Customization: Offer personalized and tailored programs that cater to 
the unique needs and goals of each client. Provide customized wellness plans, 
individualized coaching sessions, and social support networks that foster a sense of 
belonging and encourage positive lifestyle changes.
â¢ Marketing and Branding: Develop a strong brand identity that resonates with your target 
audience and communicates your business's commitment to holistic health and well-
being. Implement targeted marketing strategies, content marketing, and social media 
engagement to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle 
and the benefits of your integrated approach.
â¢ Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards in 
the healthcare and wellness industry, including data privacy laws, ethical guidelines for 
counseling services, and health and safety regulations for fitness programs. Prioritize the 
well-being and safety of your clients by adhering to industry best practices and ethical 
standards.
By addressing these critical considerations, you can establish a business that not only fulfills the 
growing demand for holistic health services but also contributes to the overall well-being and 
quality of life for your clients.
Assessment: ChatGPT had a lot of good thoughts to offer on this business idea including 
reaching out to experts in all fields of health and having up to date technology and information 
associated with each field. One issue I thought of while reading ChatGPT is that this concept 
seems very expansive and would take time and would likely take quite a few years to put the full 
business concept together. One way to make this easier might be to start with one branch of 
health and then launching the other branches along the way. The only issue I see with this 
solution is that the branding of the company wanting to be seen as treating all aspects of health 
equally might be thrown off if associated with one more than the other. Another approach could 
be to partially launch all of the branches at the same time but build on all of them once launched.
I might consider this as a business idea only because I find balancing all aspects of health 
important to me; however, it would take a lot of work to track down specialists in all three 
branches and to create a curriculum for each.
Opportunity #4: Is creating a company that helps new bands produce music a good business 
opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a company that assists new bands in producing music can indeed be 
a promising business opportunity, particularly if you have a passion for music production and a 
strong understanding of the music industry. Supporting emerging artists and providing them with 
the necessary resources and guidance can be a rewarding venture. Here are some key factors to 
consider when evaluating this business idea:
â¢ Market Demand: Evaluate the demand for music production services within your target 
market, considering the preferences and needs of new and aspiring bands. Identify the 
specific challenges that emerging artists face in the production process, such as limited 
resources, technical expertise, and access to professional recording facilities.

â¢ Comprehensive Services: Offer a comprehensive range of services, including music 
recording, mixing, mastering, and production assistance, to cater to the diverse needs of 
new bands. Provide guidance on song arrangement, instrumentation, and sound 
engineering to help artists refine their sound and achieve professional-quality recordings.
â¢ 
Industry Networking: Build strong connections and partnerships within the music 
industry, including record labels, talent agencies, and music promoters, to help new bands 
gain exposure and opportunities for music distribution and promotion. Leverage your 
network to connect artists with industry professionals and facilitate collaborations that 
can propel their careers.
â¢ 
State-of-the-Art Facilities: Invest in high-quality recording equipment, soundproof 
studios, and professional-grade musical instruments to create a conducive and inspiring 
environment for artists to unleash their creative potential. Ensure that your facilities meet 
industry standards and provide a comfortable and productive space for artists to work on 
their music.
â¢ Talent Development: Provide mentorship, workshops, and educational resources to help 
artists enhance their musical skills, songwriting abilities, and performance techniques. 
Offer guidance on music marketing, branding, and digital distribution strategies to equip 
bands with the knowledge and tools needed to succeed in the competitive music industry.
â¢ Marketing and Promotion: Develop a strategic marketing and promotion plan to 
showcase the work of the bands you support and attract a wider audience. Utilize social 
media, online platforms, and live events to promote the music and build a dedicated fan 
base for the artists under your guidance.
â¢ Contractual Agreements: Establish clear contractual agreements and terms of service that 
outline the rights and responsibilities of both your company and the bands you work with. 
Ensure transparency in financial arrangements, copyright ownership, and revenue sharing 
to foster trust and maintain positive relationships with the artists.
By considering these key factors, you can create a business that not only provides essential music 
production services but also serves as a catalyst for the growth and success of new and aspiring 
bands in the music industry.
Assessment: ChatGPT offered a lot to consider with this business venture. One of the most 
challenging aspects of this idea is industry networking, because I would need to establish my 
business as a legitimate service before I can help bands step up in the music industry. Iâm not too 
concerned with this aspect, however, and would legitimately consider this business opportunity, 
because as a commercial music major surrounded by the future of the music industry, I am 
already making connections with people who may someday help me establish credibility for my 
business.",,,,,,,,Nice! I love the extra research to explore some ideas. How much would you personally pay for these solutions? ,,,

compliance can be a hurdle.
â Sustainability: Ensuring long-term viability and impact can be 
challenging.
The evaluation of each opportunity depends on your personal goals, risk tolerance, financial 
situation, and values. It's essential to conduct thorough research, assess your own circumstances, 
and consider your long-term objectives before pursuing any of these opportunities. Additionally, 
consulting with experts or mentors in the respective fields can provide valuable insights and 
guidance.â
From this generation, these opportunities mainly come with business and entrepreneur 
investment. Any entrepreneur can create a set business like one of those opportunities. 
Thousands of individuals chose to take the real estate route for a career because it brings in good 
income and they are passionate about selling houses and more to others. Career changes are also 
very common for individuals in general. Entrepreneurs can change their career by changing the 
business they are pursuing. Real estate is very unique because you can control how many houses 
you sell. With that being said, real estate can be very tough during times. All of these 
opportunities are able and capable of starting as an entrepreneur. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

Opportunity 1: Renewable Energy Microgrids
Prompt: ""Generate an opportunity related to renewable energy microgrids.""
Output: There is a chance to create microgrids powered by renewable energy on a 
modest scale for rural areas. By producing off-grid electricity using solar or wind power, 
these microgrids can lessen reliance on conventional energy sources.
Evaluation: Given that it tackles the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, 
this opportunity has a lot of promise. It's creative since it uses renewable energy 
sources to build customized microgrids, which makes it a special and green option.
Opportunity 2: Virtual Reality in Healthcare
Prompt: ""Generate an opportunity for virtual reality in healthcare.""
Output: Patients with anxiety problems may benefit from immersive treatment 
experiences made possible by virtual reality (VR) technology. Virtual reality (VR) can 
provide therapeutic settings that are engaging and controlled, which may improve 
treatment results.
Evaluation: By addressing mental health issues with a combination of technology and 
healthcare, this possibility is creative. Virtual reality therapy holds promise as a novel 
and efficacious approach to mental health treatment.
Opportunity 3: Sustainable Packaging Solutions
Prompt: ""Generate an opportunity for sustainable packaging solutions.""
Output: Using agricultural waste products, there is a chance to create biodegradable 
packaging materials. These materials could lessen their influence on the environment 
by replacing conventional plastics.
Evaluation: This possibility fits with the growing need for environmentally friendly and 
sustainable goods. It's creative in that it uses agricultural waste for packaging, which 
makes it more environmentally friendly and sustainable, even though it might not be 
totally original.
Opportunity 4: Urban Vertical Farming
Prompt: ""Generate an opportunity for urban vertical farming.""
Output: Building vertical farming systems in cities presents a chance to cultivate fresh 
produce all year round. These farms may make the most of their land and lessen the 
carbon footprint of food production by utilizing cutting-edge hydroponic and aeroponic 
technology.
Evaluation: Although urban vertical farming is a well-established idea, this chance 
brings innovation by focusing on cutting-edge hydroponic and aeroponic systems that 
can maximize available space and increase the efficiency of urban farming. It fits 
perfectly with the increasing need for fresh, locally sourced food in urban areas.
All of these opportunities have the ability to address issues in the real world and 
provide creative solutions. The level of inventiveness varies, though. Because they 
integrate technology with important fields like energy and mental health treatment, the 
renewable energy microgrid possibility and VR-based therapy in healthcare stand out as
particularly novel and cutting edge. Opportunities for urban vertical farming and 
ecological packaging are equally promising, but they take well-established ideas and 
innovate them.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MD,1,Fall,AI,10,"For todayâs assignment I typed âWhat are four problems and their solutions that could be formed into a business?â

Output One: The first output gave me the problem of food waste, and the solution was a food waste reduction service that could partner with restaurants, grocery stores and catering companies to collect excess food to deliver to local food banks or shelters. I think that this is a really good business idea because it not only helps the local community, but also really helps the image of the business. I remember learning a long time ago that Panera took their excess bread to shelters and that has always made me feel better about Panera as a company, regardless of whether that's even still something that they do or not! Helping the community will always help the image of a business so I think that it is helpful for all parties!

Output Two: The second output gave me a solution for those that struggle with organization and time management while working remotely. The AI suggested creating organization apps, virtual coworking spaces or ergonomic home office solutions. I definitely think that people have been having a tough time getting used to working from home efficiently. Itâs easy to get distracted and stray away from your work, but also really hard to ever fully get away from your work. I think that virtual coworking spaces and better made home offices would be the way to go for this business opportunity. The app idea is cool as well, but I canât see it working as well as the other two. For this reason, I believe that this output is the worst on this list. 

Output Three: The third output involves improving mental health care by improving telehealth platforms that connect users with licensed therapists, stress reducing apps, or online support groups. I definitely can see a benefit in improving in this field, which is why I believe that this is the best outcome on this list. I think that one opportunity in particular could include having different apps for different mental health struggles. There is a very popular platform for those with OCD called NOCD that has built in support groups, places where you can ask the community for advice or ask questions, and even connect with licensed OCD specific therapists, all within this one app. I think that this would be very helpful for people with all different types of mental illnesses because it is somewhere that they can go and get every resource that they need. 

Output Four: This last outcome deals with environmental pollution by either selling biodegradable or reusable alternatives or by teaching other companies how to reduce their carbon footprint. I believe that this is a good idea because lots of people are looking at the impact that the products that they buy are having on the world, and it would be wise to either create a business that is eco friendly right off the bat, or help other companies become more eco friendly.

 ",,,,,,,,How much would you pay for these solutions? Which ones do you think you've got the skills or connections to make yourself?,,,
RG,0,Fall,AI,10,"Prompt: Generate at least 4 new problems, unmet needs, or great experiences with the emotional evidence, and come up with a unique solution that would change the experience or  resolve the problem.
1. Problem: Lack of Inclusivity in Course Materials Emotional Evidence: Frustration and alienation when course materials do not represent diverse perspectives.
Solution: A course content diversification platform that offers alternative readings, 
videos, and resources, ensuring a more inclusive educational experience.
a. 
This would be a good solution to a problem with students apart of minority 
groups, students with disabilities, and other alienated groups. Doing this 
would give students a part of these groups a better learning experience.
2. Problem: Student Health and Safety Concerns
Emotional Evidence: Anxiety and stress about personal safety, especially during late-
night walks on campus.
Solution: A campus safety app that connects students to security personnel and offers a 
virtual ""walk me home"" feature for added security.
a. 
Although CMUâs campus isnât as big as some other schools throughout the 
country, an app to make students feel safer walking on campus would be a 
good solution and could deter crimes. It could also expand throughout Mt. 
Pleasant for students who might be walking home from the bar or just 
walking somewhere off campus late at night.
3. Problem: Uncertainty about Internship and Job Market Trends
Emotional Evidence: Students feeling overwhelmed by the rapidly changing job market 
and career landscape.
Solution: A career trends and insights platform that provides real-time data and 
predictive analytics on job markets, helping students make informed career choices.
a. 
A platform like this would help students decide what they would like to do 
with their career and could help making an informative decision on what 
these students want to pursue as a career. Many students say that the ROI 
from their degree isnât worth it, and a platform like this could help them 
pursue something that would make the degree worth it.
4. Problem: Limited Access to Mental Health Resources
Emotional Evidence: The emotional burden of not being able to access mental health 
support when needed.
Solution: A teletherapy service that offers 24/7 access to licensed mental health 
professionals, including text-based therapy for immediate assistance.
a. 
A teletherapy service for students could really help students struggling with 
mental health in the privacy of their own home. A lot of students still see 
mental health and therapy as something to be ashamed of when it shouldnât 
be seen as that. I have seen this especially in men who are ashamed to seek 
help, and this could really be beneficial for those going through troubles",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

1. Sports Performance Coaching is what chat gpt said. Athletes who have a deep understanding of their sport and excel in it can consider becoming sports performance coaches or trainers. It is basically giving me opportunities to do when I am no longer a college athlete. It gave me a solution of what to do after college and something that is commonly interesting to specific athletes.

2. sport apparel or equipment brand. If you have a passion for design or a keen eye for innovative sports equipment, you can explore opportunities in starting your own sports apparel or equipment brand. this is more of something that I can do right now and hopefully get an NIL and be able to get some more money and that will fix my money problems and be the solution to those issues

1. Bali, Indonesia; Bali is a tropical paradise known for its stunning beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant cultural scene. Visitors can explore ancient temples, enjoy water sports, relax on beautiful beaches, and savor delicious Indonesian cuisine. This would solve my problem of wanting to be able to see the most beautiful places ever and be able to actually see them. 

2. Santorini Greece, Santorini is a picturesque island in the Aegean Sea, famous for its white-washed buildings with blue domes, dramatic cliffside sunsets, and crystal-clear waters. This would just be a beautiful place to be able to go see and little bit to be able to relax and reset which is something that I definitely need.",,,,,,,,"The first two could be new business opportunities if you could standout and convince people to work with you.

Input: 4 entrepreneurial solutions to problems
Output from ChatGPT:
1. 
Ride-Sharing Services: Problem: Difficulty in finding convenient and affordable transportation 
options. Solution: Companies like Uber and Lyft have created mobile apps that connect 
passengers with drivers. This innovative approach to transportation has made it easier for 
people to find rides, reduced the need for car ownership, and provided new income 
opportunities for drivers.
2. 
Meal Kit Delivery Services: Problem: Limited time for meal planning and grocery shopping. 
Solution: Companies like Blue Apron and HelloFresh offer subscription-based meal kit delivery 
services. They provide pre-portioned ingredients and recipes, allowing customers to cook fresh, 
homemade meals without the hassle of grocery shopping and meal planning.
3. 
Airbnb: Problem: Limited options for unique and affordable accommodations while traveling. 
Solution: Airbnb is a platform that allows individuals to rent out their homes or spare rooms to 
travelers. This entrepreneurial solution has disrupted the traditional hotel industry and provides 
travelers with a wide range of lodging options, often at lower prices than hotels.
4. 
Crowdfunding Platforms: Problem: Difficulty in accessing capital for creative or entrepreneurial 
projects. Solution: Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo enable entrepreneurs, artists, and 
inventors to raise funds for their projects by showcasing their ideas to a global audience. This 
form of crowdfunding has democratized access to capital, allowing individuals and small 
businesses to turn their ideas into reality.
I honestly believe the concept of Airbnbâs is the most unique and innovative entrepreneurial venture in 
the list provided by ChatGPT, especially in this day and age. For decades upon decades of the hotel 
industry reigning supreme--which often required a truckload of money and dedication to a location 
choice to start up as a ventureâsomebody thought of the idea for people to just rent out rooms and or 
multiple properties that somebody owns. It allows for more people to pursue entrepreneurial ventures 
without purchasing an entire property for a hotel. This also allows a market for people to buy multiple 
Airbnbâs to have multiple streams of income, so the opportunities are endless. Hotels also must be based
in a general touristy location to gain a fair amount of traction, but Airbnbâs can be located anywhere 
regardless of foot traffic. Overall, it was a wildly creative and unique idea that took the 
traveling/tourist/hotel industry by storm. ",,,,,,,,So how could you take those models and transfer them to a different industry?,,,
NN,1,Fall,AI,10,"I decided to seek out some opportunities in an industry I haven't thought too much about: the music industry. I typed in ""Come up with five entrepreneurial business opportunities in the music industry."" Here is what it gave me. 

Music Licensing and Sync Services: Offer a platform that connects musicians, composers, and music producers with filmmakers, advertising agencies, and other content creators seeking original music for their projects. You can help negotiate licensing deals and sync placements, earning a commission for successful matches.

I personally think this is a great idea. It gives artists/creators the opportunity to connect and collaborate together for something that can benefit both of them. I haven't heard of anything like this before, and I think people would take advantage of this service.
Online Music Education and Instruction: Develop an online platform or app that provides music lessons, tutorials, and resources for aspiring musicians. You can offer lessons in various instruments, music theory, and even production techniques. Monetize your platform through subscription fees or one-time purchases.

I also really like this idea. There are a lot of people out there who would like to learn how to play an instrument, but don't know where to start. I personally would use this service. 
Music Event Management and Promotion: Create an event management and promotion company that specializes in organizing live music events, such as concerts, festivals, and intimate gigs. You can work with artists and venues to plan and execute successful music events, earning revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, and concessions.

This is another good idea. Lots of people love attending live music and concerts. If there is a certain niche or genre of music you like, you could try to pair artists together that have similar audiences/vibes to create a successful event that people will be interested in attending. 
Music Streaming Analytics and Insights: Develop a data analytics service tailored to musicians and record labels to help them understand their audience and market better. Provide insights on how to target and engage fans, optimize streaming revenue, and make informed marketing and content decisions.

Another good idea. I'm sure there are a lot of artists/musicians out there that are curious as to what their analytics look like and how they can improve their listenership/downloads/plays etc., and understand them better. This would be a good avenue for a marketing major to take. ",,,,,,,,How much would you pay for these solutions? Which ones do you think you've got the skills or connections to make//do yourself?,,,
KP,1,Fall,AI,10,"Chat GPT Prompt Used: Help me write list of 5 opportunities, describe observations and what 
evidence there was that a problem existed or that a great experience occurred. Generate more 
details about how the solution would work or could be implemented.
Opportunities:
1. 
Opportunity 1: Student Employment and Internship Hub
Observations: Many students struggle to find part-time jobs and internships related to their fields
of study.
Evidence of Problem: Students facing financial challenges and limited career development 
opportunities.
Great Experience: Establishing a centralized platform or hub that connects students to job and 
internship opportunities within the campus and local community can greatly enhance students' 
career prospects.
Assessment: Create a system for tracking job and internship opportunities posted on your 
platform and the number of student placements. Measure the percentage of students who find 
relevant employment or internships through your hub. Gather feedback from both students and 
employers to evaluate the platform's effectiveness. Monitor user engagement and satisfaction 
through surveys and analytics.
2. 
Opportunity 2: Campus Sustainability Initiatives
Observations: Many college campuses generate significant waste and consume resources 
inefficiently.
Evidence of Problem: High amounts of waste, energy consumption, and limited recycling efforts 
on campus.
Great Experience: Colleges that implement sustainability initiatives, such as waste reduction, 
energy-efficient infrastructure, and recycling programs, not only reduce their environmental 
impact but also create a sense of community engagement and responsibility.
Evaluation: As a college student, I can collaborate with your campus administration, start or join 
environmental clubs, and propose sustainable initiatives.
Assessment: Start by setting achievable goals such as reducing waste by a certain percentage 
over a semester and increasing recycling rates. Regularly monitor waste reduction progress and
recycling efforts. Engage with fellow students to raise awareness and measure their 
participation in sustainability initiatives.
3. 
Opportunity 3: Tutoring Services
Observations: College students often require academic assistance.
Evidence of Problem: High demand for tutoring services, limited availability, and academic 
stress.
Great Experience: Organizing a tutoring service or study group program can provide academic 
support to struggling students.
Realistic Assessment: Start by recruiting tutors or organizing study groups for specific subjects. 
Track the number of students utilizing the services and collect feedback on the effectiveness of 
the support. Monitor academic improvement and success rates among participants. Aim to 
achieve a certain percentage increase in grades.
4. 
Opportunity 4: Campus Community Garden
Observations: Many campuses lack green spaces and opportunities for sustainable gardening.
Evidence of Problem: Limited access to green areas, and little engagement in sustainable 
practices.
Evaluation: This opportunity is practical and unique in its potential to create a green space for 
students. 
 Assessment: Start by planning and creating a small community garden area. Track the number 
of students involved in planting and caring for the garden. Monitor the growth of plants and the 
utilization of the space. Collect feedback on the impact of the garden on student well-being and 
sustainability awareness.

garden. It seems like a unique way for people to come together who share a liking for helping 
the environment/nature and learn about sustainability.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
CR,0,Fall,AI,10,"I typed in 4 New business Ideas that have yet to be explored.

1. Customized Nutritional Meal Plans for Pets

Develop a service that creates personalized nutritional meal plans for pets based on their breed, age, health condition, and dietary preferences. Partner with veterinarians and pet nutritionists to offer tailored, high-quality pet food subscriptions delivered directly to pet owners' doors.

This is really cool, I researched if something like this exists already and couldnt really find anything. I found the Farmers dog, which is somewhat like this concept except that it doesnt offer total customization abilities and doesnt partner with veterinarians. This concept actually could be pretty succesful if marketed right, and priced fairly. Alot of people care alot about there pets and would do this sort of thing for them often. I could see it taking some time to develop but at the end of the day i could see this being a succesful business.

 2. Personalized Digital Legacy Services

Create a platform that allows individuals to curate their digital legacy by recording personalized messages, creating virtual time capsules, and preserving their online presence for future generations. Offer services to help people organize their digital assets and memories, ensuring their online legacy is managed according to their wishes after they pass away.

I honestly really like this business Idea. For my grandpas birthday last year we got him something called story worth, Which allowes us to ask him questions about his life and he writes to us and at the end of the year they put all of his stories in a book for us to read. Something like this I think could be really cool and really touching for families when theyre friend or family passes away, I also think its really cool to look at everyones legacy weather they made it big somewhere or not. I think this allowes for the regualr ordinary person to be viewd and remebered as a celebrety which ultimatley should be how anyone is remembered. I could see alot of people getting on board with this and endorcing it to be something they honor there families with. They could do a monthly subscription or Do a system where they pay for specific things at once and they can build as they go. Ultimatley this is an idea I can get behind but maybe cause I think stuff like this is really cool.

3. Eco-Friendly Event Planning and Supplies

Launch an event planning company that specializes in organizing eco-friendly events. Provide biodegradable decorations, compostable tableware, and sustainable catering options. Offer consultations to businesses and individuals looking to host events with minimal environmental impact.

Anything to do with saving the envirement these days can catch on and I think this could be something that does. Events are huge deal and the waste from them can be pretty brutal. My dad works with events for his job and working for him sometimes I see the aftermath and it can be pretty crazy how much goes to waste. By doing this it allowes you to bring a need to an area of life while also serving people and bringing a service to people who need it. It could make you money and make you feel like your making a difference.

4. Virtual Reality Wellness Center

Create a space where people can experience virtual reality (VR) for relaxation, meditation, and therapy. Offer guided VR meditation sessions, virtual nature walks, and immersive therapy experiences to help people manage stress and improve mental well-being.

This is a cool concept, However I dont know if this is something I would get behind. I can see how this could be appealing for some people but I dont know if this would quite catch on. Being face to face with actual people and actually immersing yourself in nature is really important and by doing this I think it makes it hard for you to actually better yourself, Which is the main Goal of this whole thing. I believe if you can find a way to make this one on one and face to face with real people then maybe your on to something. I could see how this could be successful, However I dont know if alot of people would actually go after something like this.

ChatGPT gives some great business ideas 3 of which I would actually look into doing if I had investors.

AR,0,Fall,AI,10,"
I asked chat gpt to give me 4 different business opportunities and to explain them in detail.
1. Was a dropshipping business, this means instead of having your items in store you
would have a partnership with a supplier and only need to fulfill certain orders. I honestly
don't know how I feel about this specific idea. I'm honestly not very familiar with how it
works.
2. My second idea was a food truck business and it is very self explanatory. I do like this
idea though, this idea works well if you have 2 things. First would be a very populated
area that has a solid nightlife and place to sell. I also think that this would be a better
idea if you already had money to use so you wouldn't have to work there all day and
night. Instead have a crew and just pay them.
3. This idea was a digital marketing agency, this gives ideas on social media and search
engine optimization. This idea is also self explanatory but again i'm not a huge fan of this
idea. First because I think if you have a good product that it would be easy to market it.
Second, using athletes or other influencers is the best way to grow your audience.
4. PersonalFitness Training:
a. Explanation: Starting a personal fitness training business involves offering
one-on-one or group fitness training sessions. You can specialize in various
areas, such as weight loss, strength training, yoga, or specialized fitness
programs for certain demographics like seniors or athletes. Personal fitness
trainers often work independently or at gyms and fitness centers.

One of the responses to my question above in ChatGPT was the following: 

âOperating Expenses: Luxury photographers may have higher operating expenses, including top-of-the-line camera equipment, studio space, professional editing software, and marketing costsâ

I find it not that helpful because it doesnât factor in some of the travel costs that most luxury wedding photographers have to factor into their costs. 


According to ChatGPT the ideal profit margin is 20-50% for luxury wedding photographers. I was left wondering if that was accurate for other businesses which lead to my next question: 


what should my profit margin be: âââ

That led to many answers that essentially said it depends on the industry you are in.  It said to track your expenses closely to know.


4 best ways to track expenses for a photographerâ


Accounting Software:
Consider using dedicated accounting software designed for small businesses. Popular options include QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks. These tools allow you to track income and expenses, create invoices, and generate financial reports. You can categorize expenses, link your bank accounts, and easily reconcile transactions.
Spreadsheets:
Some photographers prefer using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Create a detailed expense tracking spreadsheet with columns for date, payee, description, category, and amount. You can customize the categories to fit your specific photography expenses. Regularly update the spreadsheet with your expenses and review it to monitor your financial health.
Receipt Tracking Apps:
There are several mobile apps and software solutions designed to help you track expenses by scanning and organizing receipts. Examples include Expensify, Receipts by Wave, and Shoeboxed. These apps often integrate with accounting software for seamless expense management.
Physical Receipts and Envelopes:
If you prefer a low-tech approach, you can use physical receipts and envelopes to organize your expenses. Label envelopes with expense categories and keep all related receipts in the corresponding envelopes. Regularly review and record these expenses in a ledger or spreadsheet.
When tracking expenses as a photographer, it's essential to categorize your expenses accurately to gain insights into where your money is going. Common expense categories for photographers might include:

Camera equipment (lenses, bodies, tripods, etc.)
Studio or office rent
Utilities (if applicable)
Marketing and advertising
Office supplies
Transportation (e.g., mileage, gas, vehicle maintenance)
Software and subscriptions (e.g., photo editing software)
Insurance (e.g., liability insurance)
Travel expenses (if you have destination shoots)
Props and backdrops
Professional development and training
Office equipment (e.g., computers, printers)

I found the list that ChatGPT gave helpful but in a previous list it gave Quickbooks and other programs like that as a solution and I would find those more helpful.",,,,,,,,"Profit margin often depends on the kind of business you have. If you have tons of customers you don't need much of a profit margin, if you only have a few or those that are seasonal then you need a higher one. When starting up it is usually best to go higher because it gives you room to make mistakes with your cost estimates.

This also has to do with how you do your pricing-cost plus vs market vs. value-based (most specific).",,,

I think I narrowed down some opportunities that I would be interested in. I would have to learn more about how to develop these ideas in the field of agriculture. Out of the four, one that seems interesting to me is the precision farming one.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
AT,1,Fall,AI,10,"
The Prompt: âPossible business solutions for relieving carsickness.â
The Opportunities:
1. Motion-Sickness Relief Apps
a. The Output: âDevelop mobile apps with guided relaxation exercises, soothing
visuals, and audio content to help passengers manage motion sickness during a
journey.â
b. 
I like how innovative this idea is; thereâs nothing like it already in existence. It
reminds me of the app, Calm, but with a different purpose. I think it is a clever
idea and has good potential. It would be a somewhat easy solution as people
always have their phones with them, especially in the car. However, the
motion-sick person in me is hesitant because looking at my phone or other
electronics usually makes me feel more car-sick. Usually I can only look out the
window. Because of this it makes me wonder if other people would be willing to
try it. I think that in order to convince consumers that it works, many tests would
need to be conducted in order to present evidence that it truly works.
2. Virtual Reality (VR) Entertainment
a. The Output: âDesign VR systems and content that can be used in vehicles to
distract passengers from motion discomfort. VR experiences can be tailored to
reduce feelings of nausea.â
b. 
I actually really like this idea. I think itâs similar to the first opportunity:
motion-sickness relief apps, yet it seems without the possible obstacles. Although
you would still feel the movement of the car, I think itâs possible that VR
glasses/goggles could trick your mind. Out of all the opportunities, I think that
this one has the highest possibility of working. My own struggles with
car-sickness put me at somewhat of an advantage with these possible
opportunities because my thoughts and opinions are probably the same as the
target marketsâ. With all of the other opportunities, I can sense some skepticism.
However, VR is the only opportunity that I could see working and not being met
with criticism.
3. Air Quality and Scent Control

a. The Output: âDevelop systems that control air quality and scents in vehicles, as
odors and poor air quality can exacerbate motion sickness. Implement technology
to filter and purify the air.â
b. For this specific opportunity, Iâm thinking of a product like an air/car freshener.
Maybe taking it a step further and having it be a âsmartâ device like the Pura.
Having it be smart might be somewhat difficult if not connected to wifi, as such
products rarely work without it. Obviously a car freshener is not a revolutionary
idea, however what would be is the motion-sickness relieving scent and
purification abilities. I might even take it a step further and have it be a scent that
prevents motion-sickness. From someone who suffers from car-sickness, itâs
incredibly difficult to feel better after it hits. It kind of sticks with you until you
get out of the car, walk around, and let it pass. That being said, the winning idea is
to have a scent that works to prevent car-sickness in the first place. There might
also be a setting on the freshener that allows you to purify the air in the difficult if
someone does get sick, that way itâs not just sitting in the car for the duration of
the trip.
4. Nausea-Reducing Snacks and Drinks
a. The Output: âProduce and market snacks and drinks with ingredients known to
alleviate nausea, such as ginger or peppermint, specifically for consumption
during car trips.â
b. Although I do think that this is an opportunity for a product line of snacks/drinks
that are specifically aimed towards relieving motion-sickness, I donât think itâs the
best option. I could see curiosities being piqued while walking past the products
in a grocery store or pharmacy, but I think most people would just gravitate most
towards raw ginger or Sprite; common alleviations. I think that this opportunity
would also work best if its aimed towards preventing car-sickness, rather than
alleviating it. The reason for this is because I have gotten car-sick before and the
absolute last thing I feel like doing is eating or drinking. In fact, when thereâs
substance in my stomach, itâs most likely that I will throw it up. I am 100% sure
most people would feel the same. Another adaptation to this opportunity that I
might make is to use ingredients like ginger, but having it masked so that it canât
be tasted. For example, maybe Iâd start with a granola bar, something that is easy
to get down, and have it contain ginger but have it taste like chocolate. I think an
aspect like that could be a driving force for consumers when it comes to deciding
whether or not to purchase.
I actually think all four of these opportunities are unique and innovative. In general, none
of these opportunities are new ideas, but I have never seen them directed towards relieving
motion sickness. The only of these opportunities that might differ from this fact is nausea
reducing snacks and drinks. Foods and drinks with ingredients like ginger and/or peppermint are
not a new invention. However, I have never seen a line of snacks, foods, and/or drinks that is
aimed directly at relieving car-sickness.",,,,,,,, I love the wondering you are doing as part of your evaluation. How much would you pay for these solutions? Which ones do you think you've got the skills or connections to make yourself?,,,
ZT,1,Fall,AI,10,"Problem 1: Slow Internet Connection Solution:
Check your router and modem: Ensure they are in good working condition, and
consider upgrading if they are outdated.
Optimize your Wi-Fi: Position your router in a central location, use 5GHz for faster
connections, and reduce interference by placing it away from electronic devices.
Clear cache and cookies: Regularly clear the cache and cookies on your web
browser to improve loading times.
Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP): If the issue persists, reach out to your
ISP to troubleshoot or consider upgrading to a faster plan.
Analysis: I think this analysis overall is good, I just think ChatGPT could of included
resetting the internet connection but unplugging it and plugging it back in or turning it off
by the little switch in the back, this way is the most known and common way but has
helped fix any internet issues I have experienced most of the time.
Problem 2: Procrastination Solution:
Set SMART goals: Break tasks into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and
Time-bound goals to make them more manageable.
Create a to-do list: Organize your tasks in a list and prioritize them based on
urgency and importance.
Use time management techniques: Techniques like the Pomodoro technique
(working for 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break) can help you stay focused.
Find accountability partners: Share your goals with a friend or colleague who can
help keep you on track.
Analysis: I actually have used some techniquest ChatGPT had generated here for problem
two. SMART goals is something that is common and I feel like is an easy fix for some
people to help with their procrastination. I also find persionally that the accountability
partners is a good suggestion as it offers someone other than yourself to keep you
accountable and when paired with another strategey that ChatGPT offered these solutions
could be quite effective.
Problem 3: Financial Debt Solution:
Create a budget: Analyze your income and expenses to create a budget that allows
you to live within your means.
Prioritize debt payments: Focus on high-interest debts first while making minimum
payments on others.
Seek additional income: Look for part-time jobs, freelance work, or other
opportunities to increase your income.
Consult a financial advisor: If the debt is overwhelming, consider seeking advice
from a financial advisor to create a debt repayment plan.
Analysis: I personally am not a big fan of the solutions offered here, as one of the
solutions costs money (getting a financial advisor), although it is a great idea when

someone is in an overwhelming debt situation they might not be able to afford hiring a
financial advisor to assist them in making those decisions. However the smartest solution
offered here is the one that suggests to pay the high interest debts first as they can hurt
your credit more.
Problem 4: Stress and Anxiety Solution:
Practice mindfulness and meditation: Engage in relaxation techniques to calm your
mind and reduce stress.
Exercise regularly: Physical activity releases endorphins, which can help improve
your mood and reduce anxiety.
Seek social support: Talk to friends and family about your concerns and share your
feelings with a support network.
Consult a mental health professional: If stress and anxiety become chronic or
unmanageable, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor for specialized
assistance.
Analysis: I really like this section of ChatGPT solutopn and problem solving. As
someone who has anxiety the solutions that are suggested are perfect and are what any
therapist will tell someone when discussing how to decrease their levels of anxiety. The
only thing I would also add in this section though is to contact a doctor for a prescription
SSRI or by changing their diet and cut out sugar, gluten, and caffeine as these have been
proven to increase levels of hyperactivity in the brain.
Overall Analysis:
The prompt I put into generate the problems and solutions by ChatGPT is âGenerate 4 problems
and come up with solutions for each.â This prompt gave ChatGPT freedom to choose which
topic, popular or not which I feel maximized ChatGPT opportunity in picking what it wanted to
give me. However overall I would not consider any of these solutions unique as many of them
are things that would come up when you Google the problem offered by ChatGPT.",,,,,,,,"Remember we are trying to re-train your brain to not just solve problems but to do it in a certain way, namely come up with a creative system that addresses an unmet need while producing a profit. So the solutions need to be packaged in such a way that you or others could buy or sell it. Many of the solutions are free options or just procedural knowledge and not entrepreneurial opportunities.",,,

BW,1,Fall,AI,10,"These are the answers I got from ChatGPT and I asked about innovative ways to organize makeup items.

Smart Makeup Organizers: Develop smart makeup organizers that use technology to help users keep track of their makeup inventory. These organizers could have built-in barcode scanners or RFID tags to identify and categorize products. Users can use a smartphone app to see what they have and receive expiration date reminders. The organizer could also suggest makeup looks based on the products available.

Modular and Customizable Storage: Create modular and customizable makeup storage solutions that can adapt to different collections and preferences. This could include stackable drawers, adjustable dividers, and interchangeable compartments to accommodate various makeup products, from lipsticks and eyeshadows to brushes and skincare items.

Compact and Portable Organizers: Design compact and portable makeup organizers for people who are frequently on the go. These organizers should be durable, lightweight, and space-efficient, with secure compartments and mirrors for quick touch-ups. They could be foldable or expandable to fit different-sized bags and provide easy access to essential products.

Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Options: Develop eco-friendly makeup organizers made from sustainable materials and featuring reusable, refillable, or biodegradable components. These organizers could promote sustainability in the beauty industry and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, they could incorporate recycled or upcycled materials.

solve this problem is to create gloves specially for drumline that grip the sticks so that the sticks wonât

the business idea of creating an audio program that is user friendly so that anyone can use it without

the complicated one can use this one and people who are used to the simpler one can transition easier.

MD,1,Fall,Observation,11,"The first opportunity that I came up with today came to me while I was watching one of my favorite TV shows, Pretty Little Liars. I will be the first to admit that Pretty Little Liars is not a cinematic masterpiece, but I still really enjoy it! So I was watching an episode this morning that included one of the main characters trying to hack into a phone. What I thought was funny about this is that the code that they had across the screen while this character was hacking into the phone made it glaringly obvious that whoever put that together had no idea what that code was supposed to look like. This is fine for a show like this, but it got me thinking about how other shows that want to be taken more seriously do this kind of stuff. How do you make something like coding or medical topics or even a niche topic such as video games or horseback riding look convincing when youâre not in the field of those things, youâre in the field of television. I thought that a cool and easy way to help include difficult or niche topics into television in an accurate way would be to have a website where experts can sign up to help with television shows and movies remotely. Iâm sure that experts are obviously already consulted with when making this type of content, but I think that it would be nice if there was one website, similar to a customized experience of Masterclass where TV staff can speak to an expert about any concept that will be covered on their show. The experience would be easy, simple and efficient.",,,,,,,,Nice work!  ,,,

Unfortunately, I would never trust myself to create my own because I am awful at graphic design. This got me thinking about how for someone who is good at graphic design and enjoys planners, a small business that they could start could be an Etsy shop where people can customize how they want their planner to be set up (horizontal pages, vertical pages, etc), what they want their included on their weekly pages (to do lists, space for a quote or bible verse, meal plans etc), and just overall what they want the extra pages to look like.

I think that a lot of people feel the same way as me, and would really appreciate a website where you can type in your dad (or whoever youâre buying for) interests and the website will generate actual gift ideas that they would enjoy. The way that the website could make money is through featuring different companyâs products and earning commission every time there is a sale. That way it would be free to users which would make it more welcoming!

This could be helpful for when you're in a grocery store and your child may wander off, or in the event that your child may be lost. This experience I'm sure causes a lot of anxiety, especially for parents with children that are prone to running. This would help ease the minds of parents and it will also help let the child know that they will always be connected to their parents in case they get lost!  ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MD,1,Fall,Observation,12,"The third business opportunity came to me because I have an autoimmune condition that flares up sometimes with hives and allergic reactions. This is really scary sometimes because I never really know when I should go to the hospital. Sometimes it stops on its own and sometimes it escalates. Usually my doctor can tell how much it will spread by looking at the hive pattern but I never know myself. I think that it would be reassuring and helpful to have an app that can let you know if you should seek medical attention based on the rash or symptoms that you're having. That way, you won't accidentally go to the hospital when you don't need to, and you won't accidentally underestimate how serious a rash is when you should be going to the hospital.

That's when I thought of a business idea that could help people that aren't naturals when it comes to decorating, but want their house to look polished and put-together. There could be a website where you can put in your decoration style and the company would send you a subscription box every few months with new seasonal decorations that fit your home's style and color scheme.

products that have bad reviews to see what opportunities I can see. I found a permanent tattoo removal 
cream that had only 2 stars out of 5. Lots of people were saying the product did not work at all. This 
could be a cool product if it did in fact work, so I sought to see how I could improve it. Since a lot of 
people were complaining about the formula, I would work to adjust the formula and probably make it 
more potent. I would also seek to serve it by prescription only considering I would want to up the 
strength. I think it would be a good cream to have not as a full replacement for laser tattoo removal, but 
to make the process easier for those interested and allow them to have less sessions at the laser removal
place. I think people would be interested in this as a solution because in the long run it would save them

This would work by taking books that circulate the system majoraty of the books would be used however it would make more sense. Once your done with the book you send it back into the program while the book waits for the next person. This is able to happen almost like whole sale and retail. The company buys all the books and loans them to students for a certain amount of time while they are subscribed to the service. Say the subscription costs 12$ a month.

a. My dogs are always awake and ready to start their days at a much earlier time
than I am. I prefer to sleep in and my dogs are awake at 6 AM like clockwork
every morning.
b. My solution to this is a food âbowlâ with a timer that dispenses the correct
amount of food at the time selected. This is probably a pretty self explanatory
idea. In fact, Iâm drawing inspiration from the water bowls that resemble water
dispensers for humans. In this case you would put food into the jug and it would
store it until eating time. It gives you the option of deciding how many cups of
food you want it to dispense and at what time(s) of day. For example, my puppy
eats twice a day, 1.5 cups/feeding, at 7 AM and again at 6 PM. After making those
selections on the touchscreen, the food will dispense at the correct times and in
the correct amounts. After entering those selections for the first time you wouldnât
have to again unless you needed to. The only other thing youâd have to do is refill
the food every so often depending on how much your dog eats.
c. As I mentioned, I drew inspiration from a product already on the market.
However, I applied the idea to something different. To my knowledge, this is a
unique product when it comes to feeding your dog. Iâve never seen or heard of a
product like this, designed to feed your dog. I think it would be relatively simple
to create and market as well. Many, if not most, dog owners would be interested
in something like this because it makes their lives easier and saves them some
time and energy",,,,,,,,Well done! You may want to start estimating how much you would be willing to pay for your solutions.,,,
AT,1,Fall,Observation,12,"Wanting to paint but not being able to draw
a. 
I attended a painting workshop today with a friend. The theme was âPaint Your
Pet.â Beforehand you uploaded a picture of your pet and then an artist would
sketch the image on a canvas for you to paint during the class. I had so much fun
but it was so difficult figuring out which of my two pets to paint first. The next
class isnât until December and thereâs a chance we might miss it due to moving
which means I had to make a difficult decision and show a little favoritism.
Actually, I just decided to paint the dog we got first, our eldest. It got me thinking
about how much I wish I could draw so that I could paint at home. I really want a
canvas to paint our other dog but there is no way Iâd be able to sketch her. I even
asked my friend if she could sketch the image for me to paint.
b. My solution to this is a printer that will scan the linework of an image onto a
piece of paper, canvas, or other form of media. Technically, it wouldnât
necessarily be a printer, more of a scanner but the image of the product would be
very similar. You would select the image you wanted on your computer or smart
device. Youâd be able to choose from an assortment of images that the software
offers as well as uploading your own as well. Then, you would place the media in
the tray and press the start button. From there, the image would be scanned onto
the media without using ink. The aspect of not requiring ink would be very
attractive to a lot of people. I know having to purchase ink every so often turns
me off from using my printer at home. It is very inconvenient to have ink on hand
and it is also quite expensive. Because this product would most likely be
expensive, I picture businesses like libraries purchasing it for residents to use.

or âNovaâs dad.â Since weâve been going for multiple years, we do know the name of the
owners now too! Unrelatedly, we have friends who are a couple and they recently
purchased and renovated a property with a beautiful outdoor pool area. Thereâs a little
volcano pool, splash pad, etc.. I was looking at the listing when they posted it and sadly
no dogs are allowed which I understand. But, it made me think about how I would love
something like that where my dogs could go, especially my puppy. It would be a great

way to get her energy out and expose her to new places. I know thereâs an app called
Sniffspot that is basically AIRBnBâs but for dogs, and it's booked by the hour. The idea is
that you can book a space for a couple of hours and not have to worry about other dogs. I
do think this is a great idea for reactive dogs or dogs who are uncomfortable around
others. But, my dogs love playing with other dogs and Iâm also trying to avoid taking
them to the Dog Beach where theyâll pick up tons of sand.
a. My solution/opportunity to this is a dog amusement/water park. To start, Iâm not
thinking of a park the size of Disney World or Disneyland. Instead, something
relatively small until all of the kinks are worked out. Iâm thinking of starting with
a Splash Pad since dogs canât really go down water slides. There will be many
contraptions sprouting water built out of the ground, and shooting upwards. There
will be a maximum of 10 dogs at a time to start. People would book a slot for 2
hours, leave, and then a new crew of dogs would arrive to play.
b. 
I know for sure that people would love this idea and would pay to use a facility
like this. Especially in California where it can get hot. San Diego specifically, is a
VERY dog friendly city. Everyone here not only loves, but is obsessed with their
dogs. I have many friends who view their dogs as their babies, myself included.
They would do anything to spoil their dogs. Itâs also a wonderful opportunity to
tire your dog(s) out with minimal effort on your part. Itâs important to note that
this facility would of course be fenced in and there would be vaccination and
behavioral qualifications.",,,,,,,,Well done! You may want to start estimating how much you would be willing to pay for your solutions.,,,
ZT,1,Fall,Observation,12,"Obesity In America
â Many individuals in America struggle with their weight, espically when it concerns them
being overweight. Now there are a plethora of reasons on why someone could weigh
more than someone else due to certain health reasons however the main csuse of
obesity in American is the lack of nutrition education. Along with the lack of nutrition
education in schools there is also a lack of gym equipment education to encourage a
healthy active lifestyle. To decrease this very prevalent issue in America having classes
that are required for students to learn about nutrition and general exercise will help
encourage a healthy lifestyle and hopefully bring down the obesity rate eventually in
America. The closest thing offered at\ the moment for students in the American school
system is a nutrition class however there is not a class completely designed on the
health and wellness of an individual regharding their weight and lifestyle chloices. Some
individuals that would need to get involved to make this a nation wide thing is possibly
the president or someone who has a background in voicing their opinions on obesity in
America like Michelle Obama.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

â As a college student the price of planners cna get expensive over the years, especially if
I am planning on having a busy semester because that means I will have to buy a bigger
planner to be able to write down everything. A calender can be great but can be a
tedious process when adding every single thing. However something that would make
this process easier, and something that would be ablt to give the user notifications is a
smart planner. Similar to the design of a tablet but only exclusively for planning and time
management. This smart planner will have a program where according to the users
schedule can make alarms the notify the user the best times to relax, study, clean, cook
etc. therefore making it easier for someone who has a busy schedule to stay in check
with everything. A tablet would be a big competitor but what would make the smart
planner better or worth the money for the consumer is that it would easier to add their
plans into the smart planner in comparison to the tablet. People or companies that coils
get involved are some of the bigger planner companies, this will give them a competitive

â Concrete is something we see everyday and touch in some way, shape, or form. With
concrete being in our evgeryday livesd it would make sense that it is durable and can
withstand the elements of the Earth, especially its movements. Well concrete isnt as
durable as many would think and can crack to the smallest movements once it has
settled. This doesnt just make concrete frustrating to deal with but also needoing more
fixes throughout the years with everyday use. Coming up with a newer more durable
recipe for concrete will allow cities to save money on doing construction on the roads,
sidewalks, and local buildings, therefore allowing the saved money to be used on other
things that need the focus. Because of the current recipe opf concrete if the recipe is
able to become more durable there will be a lack of competition because the new recipe
will be able to overpower the other forms of concrete when tested against the Earths

Order of what I believed to be good business opportunities: #3, #2, #4, and #1
Opportunity #1: Would renting rooms and VR headsets to people to explore different points in 
history and different places throughout the world be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Renting rooms and VR headsets to offer immersive historical and global 
travel experiences could indeed be a unique and potentially lucrative business opportunity, 
especially as virtual reality (VR) technology continues to advance. However, there are several 
key considerations to keep in mind:
â¢ Market demand: Research the demand for historical and global travel experiences 
through VR within your target market. Identify the demographics and interests of 
potential customers who would be interested in such experiences.
â¢ VR technology and content: Ensure that you have access to high-quality VR headsets and 
a diverse library of historically accurate and visually immersive content. Collaborate with 
content creators or develop your own content to provide unique and engaging experiences 
for your customers.
â¢ Location and ambiance: Choose a suitable location that can accommodate the VR 
experiences, considering factors such as space, comfort, and accessibility. Create an 
immersive and comfortable environment that complements the virtual experiences and 
enhances the overall customer journey.
â¢ Marketing and promotion: Develop a robust marketing strategy to reach potential 
customers and create awareness about the unique experiences you offer. Utilize social 
media, partnerships with travel agencies, and targeted advertising to generate interest and 
attract customers to your VR rental service.
â¢ 
Pricing model: Determine a competitive and profitable pricing structure that reflects the 
value of the immersive experiences you provide. Consider factors such as rental duration, 
the quality of VR content, and the overall experience you offer to customers.
â¢ Customer feedback and experience enhancement: Gather feedback from customers to 
understand their preferences and continuously improve your offerings. Regularly update 
your VR content library to keep customers engaged and excited about exploring new 
historical eras and global destinations.
â¢ Legal considerations: Familiarize yourself with any legal requirements or regulations 
related to VR rental services in your location. Ensure compliance with data protection 
and privacy regulations, especially if you are collecting customer data during the rental 
process.
By addressing these considerations, you can create a unique and engaging business that caters to 
the growing demand for immersive and educational experiences. Continuous innovation, 
attention to customer feedback, and a commitment to providing high-quality content and 
experiences will be key to the success of your VR rental business.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave me some very good insights on this business venture including 
authenticity and legal considerations. Authenticity is something I really need to keep in mind 
when creating these virtual reality worlds because quality of the experience is one of the number 
one things that customers will be looking for. One thing I didnât consider at first was the legal 
side of it. Iâm not sure entirely what that would entail, but if I pursued this business venture, I 
would investigate it more. This is a less likely business idea I would pursue mostly because the 
idea doesnât interest me that much.
Opportunity #2: Would beginning a program that would promote reducing, reusing, and 
recycling in schools be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Starting a program that promotes reducing, reusing, and recycling in schools 
can be a beneficial and socially responsible business opportunity. It not only helps in fostering 
environmental consciousness among students but also contributes to building a sustainable 
future. Here are some key points to consider when developing such a program:
â¢ Educational curriculum: Design an engaging and age-appropriate educational curriculum 
that educates students about the importance of reducing waste, reusing materials, and 
recycling. Collaborate with educators and schools to integrate this curriculum into their 
existing programs.
â¢ 
Interactive workshops and activities: Organize interactive workshops, activities, and 
events that encourage hands-on learning and practical application of reducing, reusing, 
and recycling concepts. These activities can include waste reduction challenges, 
upcycling projects, and community clean-up initiatives.
â¢ 
Partnerships with schools and educational institutions: Establish partnerships with 
schools and educational institutions to implement your program effectively. Offer 
training sessions for teachers and staff to ensure the smooth integration of your 
curriculum into the school's existing framework.
â¢ Awareness campaigns: Launch awareness campaigns that involve students, parents, and 
the broader community. Utilize social media, newsletters, and community events to 
spread awareness about the importance of sustainable practices and the impact of waste 
on the environment.
â¢ 
Sustainability products and services: Offer sustainable products and services that schools 
can use to promote a culture of sustainability. This can include providing recycling bins, 
composting systems, and eco-friendly school supplies to encourage eco-conscious 
behaviors among students and staff.
â¢ Measure and showcase impact: Establish a system to measure the impact of your program 
in terms of waste reduction, recycling rates, and overall environmental awareness. Share 
these impact metrics with the schools, communities, and potential stakeholders to
demonstrate the effectiveness of your program.
â¢ 
Funding and grants: Explore funding opportunities and grants that support environmental 
education and sustainability initiatives in schools. Securing funding can help expand your 
program and reach a broader audience, enabling you to make a more significant impact in 
the education sector.
By combining educational initiatives with practical activities and community engagement, you 
can create a comprehensive program that instills environmental values and encourages 

sustainable practices among students, educators, and the community. Additionally, the positive 
impact on the environment and society can help your business establish a strong reputation and 
make a meaningful contribution to building a more sustainable future.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights into this business idea including consulting 
educators on creating a curriculum for the students. This is a very good suggestion so that I can 
know whether or not kids are truly learning the importance of sustainability. I would consider 
pursuing this business venture because sustainability is something that I believe to be important 
and creating a program to help educate kids would be good for society.
Opportunity #3: Would creating a business that rents out practice rooms for musicians be a good 
business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a business that rents out practice rooms for musicians can be a 
promising opportunity, especially in areas with a vibrant music scene and a significant number of 
aspiring musicians. Here are some factors to consider when evaluating this business idea:
â¢ Market demand: Research the local music community to assess the demand for practice 
rooms. Identify the specific needs and preferences of musicians, bands, and music 
students in terms of practice space requirements, equipment availability, and affordable 
rental options.
â¢ Location: Choose a convenient and easily accessible location that is central to the target 
demographic of musicians. Consider proximity to music schools, recording studios, and 
performance venues to attract a steady flow of customers.
â¢ 
Facility and equipment: Ensure that your practice rooms are equipped with the necessary 
amenities, including soundproofing, quality instruments and equipment, and comfortable 
furnishings. Providing a conducive environment for musicians to rehearse and practice is 
essential for customer satisfaction and retention.
â¢ 
Flexible rental options: Offer flexible and affordable rental options to accommodate the 
varying needs of musicians, whether they require short-term or long-term practice space. 
Consider offering hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly rental packages to cater to different 
budgets and usage requirements.
â¢ Additional services: Consider offering additional services such as instrument storage, 
recording equipment rental, and access to sound engineers or music instructors to 
enhance the value proposition for your customers.
â¢ Marketing and promotion: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to reach out to 
local musicians and music communities. Utilize online platforms, social media, and 
partnerships with music schools, bands, and local music events to promote your practice 
room rental services.
â¢ Customer experience and feedback: Focus on delivering an exceptional customer 
experience by maintaining clean and well-maintained practice rooms, providing excellent 
customer service, and incorporating customer feedback to improve your services 
continually.

â¢ Legal and noise regulations: Familiarize yourself with local zoning laws and noise 
regulations to ensure compliance with legal requirements related to operating a practice 
room facility. Soundproofing your rooms adequately and adhering to noise restrictions 
will help you avoid potential legal issues and maintain a positive relationship with the 
community.
By addressing these factors, you can create a business that serves the needs of local musicians 
and fosters a supportive and collaborative music community. Providing musicians with a 
professional and well-equipped space for practice can contribute to the growth and development 
of the local music scene, making your practice room rental business a valuable asset to the music 
industry.
Assessment: ChatGPT provided some very good insights into how this could be a promising 
business venture. One point that came up a couple times was ensuring the rooms rented are 
soundproofed. As a musician I understand the importance of this, because soundproofing is not 
only an issue with people outside the room, but also the musician because they typically donât 
like passersby listening to them practicing. One other point to consider is the businessâ proximity 
to my clienteleâs location including music schools and concert halls. I would consider pursuing 
this business because I understand the needs of the clientele, which is a large part of running a 
business.
Opportunity #4: Would creating a system that helps high school and college students get 
connected with jobs be a good business opportunity?
ChatGPT Answer: Creating a system that helps high school and college students connect with 
job opportunities can indeed be a lucrative and socially impactful business opportunity. Here are 
some key considerations to help you evaluate the viability of this idea:
â¢ Market research: Conduct thorough market research to understand the current job 
landscape for high school and college students. Identify the specific needs, challenges, 
and preferences of both students and employers within your target demographic.
â¢ 
Platform development: Build an intuitive and user-friendly online platform that connects 
students with job opportunities, internships, part-time positions, and relevant career 
resources. Ensure that the platform offers features such as job search filters, resume 
building tools, and interview preparation resources.
â¢ 
Partner with educational institutions: Establish partnerships with high schools, colleges, 
and universities to gain access to a wider student network and to build credibility within 
the education sector. Collaborate with career services departments and student 
organizations to promote your platform and its services to the student body.
â¢ Employer engagement: Cultivate relationships with local businesses, companies, and 
organizations to create a diverse pool of job opportunities for students. Encourage 
employers to post job openings, internships, and entry-level positions on your platform, 
highlighting the benefits of hiring young talent and contributing to their professional 
development.

â¢ 
Personalized career guidance: Offer personalized career guidance and mentorship 
programs that assist students in exploring their career interests, building relevant skills, 
and preparing for the job application process. Provide workshops, webinars, and 
networking events to help students develop essential professional skills and expand their 
career prospects.
â¢ Mobile accessibility: Ensure that your platform is accessible via mobile devices, as many 
students prefer to use smartphones for job searches and application processes. Develop a 
mobile application that provides a seamless user experience and allows students to access 
job opportunities on the go.
â¢ Data security and privacy: Implement robust security measures to protect student data 
and ensure the privacy of personal information shared on your platform. Establish 
transparent data management practices and comply with data protection regulations to 
build trust among students and educational institutions.
â¢ Marketing and promotion: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that targets both 
students and employers. Utilize social media, email campaigns, and targeted advertising 
to create awareness about your platform and attract a significant user base of students and 
job providers.
By addressing these considerations, you can establish a valuable platform that bridges the gap 
between students and job opportunities, helping them kickstart their careers and gain valuable 
professional experience. Providing a comprehensive and supportive ecosystem for career 
development can contribute to the success of your business and make a meaningful impact on the 
future workforce.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights into this business opportunity including 
looking into creating a personalized experience for the students by offering resources such as 
webinars and workshops to help them. Another insight that I hadnât considered was to make the 
system accessible via mobile devices. I would create an app version for students to use on their 
phone to make the system more accessible so that students can use the system on the go. I would
consider this business idea, because it would be a great system to have, and it fits with my major 
of entrepreneurship.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

Generate 4 different business opportunities that could solve problems in todays society
1. 
Sustainable Packaging Solutions: Problem: With the increasing concern over 
environmental sustainability, there is a growing need for eco-friendly packaging 
alternatives to reduce plastic waste and its impact on the environment. Business 
Opportunity: Start a company that specializes in designing and manufacturing 
sustainable packaging materials and solutions. This could include biodegradable 
packaging, reusable containers, and innovative materials that reduce the 
environmental footprint of packaging.
2. 
Mental Health and Wellness Services: Problem: Mental health issues are on the 
rise, exacerbated by the stresses of modern life and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Many people need accessible and affordable mental health support. Business 
Opportunity: Develop a platform or app that offers virtual therapy and mental 
health support. This platform could connect users with licensed therapists, 
provide self-help resources, and offer a community for individuals to share their 
experiences and find support.
3. 
Urban Vertical Farming: Problem: With the global population growing and the 
increasing strain on traditional agricultural practices, there is a need for more 
sustainable and efficient ways to produce fresh food in urban areas. Business 
Opportunity: Establish a vertical farming business that uses innovative 
technologies to grow a variety of crops in vertical structures within urban 
environments. This would enable local, year-round production of fresh produce, 
reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation and providing fresh 
food to urban populations.
4. 
E-Waste Recycling and Upcycling: Problem: The rapid advancement of 
technology has led to a surge in electronic waste (e-waste), causing 
environmental pollution and resource wastage. Business Opportunity: Create a 
company focused on e-waste collection, recycling, and upcycling. You can offer 
services to individuals and businesses to responsibly dispose of and repurpose 
their old electronic devices. This business can also explore creative ways to turn 
e-waste into useful products, contributing to a circular economy and reducing 
electronic waste's environmental impact.
1.) 
Building a business around sustainable packaging would not be a bad idea but the big packaging 
businesses could easily push you out if they started implementing similar packaging as you. I 
think it would be a better idea to introduce better packaging to the big businesses so they could 
mass produce it and create a positive change for the environment. 
2.) 
Mental health services are already a thing but there could be more of it. 
3.) 
I think Urban Vertical Farming would be a great idea for already existing businesses like grocery 
stores in the city. 
4.) 
We are already working towards better waste management, but it would not hurt if more people
put an effort into this idea.
I would not pursue any of these ideas because none of them are in my interests, but they are 
good ideas to think about. The only idea that seems very innovative would be urban vertical

Output One: Traffic And Transportation Woes

First off, I will say that I do definitely recognize this as an issue that could be better solved. I wrote earlier about how the mix of traffic and construction that I was not aware of has affected my commutes to work, and I think that overall, traffic is just a really negative start to peopleâs days, so it would be a great place to innovate. The solution that was given for this problem is an app with real time updates and recommendations on which roads to take. I see this as a really good solution, and I would go one step further to say that the app should partner with Google or Apple Maps so that consumers wouldnât have to stop using the GPS apps that they know and trust to use this new product.

Output Two: Home Cleaning And Maintenance

I can definitely see a need for this type of solution. It would be great if there were a website for all house care and maintenance needs, ranging from electrical issues, to plumbing, to gardening and overall cleaning. I think that it would be effective to have the ability to type in what you need done and be able to scroll through a list of professionals in your area that could help. Each professional could have a profile set up so you could see their skills and ratings. I like this idea a lot and think that it is my favorite output of the list.

This is one of the outputs that I donât necessarily think is a great idea. The AI suggests that you could set up a wellness coaching and fitness training service to help people with their wellness. The reason that I donât love this method is because I am into fitness and wellness myself, and with all of the free resources out there with Youtube, Instagram, TikTok and more, I really think that fitness programs are on their way out. I follow several people on Youtube that provide workout guides that are really well executed and because of their existence, I really donât see a need for paid programs and guides. This is my least favorite output.

Output Four: Time Management and Productivity Issues

I think that there is a lot of room for innovation in this general area, but I donât like the AI generated solution. The AI suggested that a good solution would be to set up a coaching service that would help people with their time management and organization, but if Iâm struggling with not having enough time, the last thing that I would want to do is set aside MORE time to meet with a coach. I think that a more effective solution would be to create materials that someone could incorporate within their life that wouldnât create too much of a disruption like a planner or an app to track productivity for example.

Prompt: Generate 4 different opportunities and evaluate each. Give extensive 
details about how the solution would work or could be implemented.
Opportunity 1: Renewable Energy Microgrids in Remote Areas
Opportunity Description:
Many remote areas around the world lack access to a reliable source of 
electricity. Implementing renewable energy microgrids in these regions can 
provide clean and sustainable power sources, improving the quality of life for
local communities.
Evaluation:
â¢ 
How it works: Develop and install solar, wind, or hydro power systems 
with battery storage in remote areas. Establish a microgrid to 
distribute and manage the energy locally. This will provide electricity 
for lighting, cooking, and powering essential devices and appliances.
â¢ 
Implementation: Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and 
renewable energy companies to secure funding and technical 
expertise. Train residents to maintain and operate the microgrid.
â¢ 
Feasibility: The feasibility depends on factors like the availability of 
renewable resources, initial investment costs, local support, and 
community involvement.
This idea reduces reliance on fossil fuels, improves the living conditions of remote 
communities, and can stimulate economic development in these areas.
Opportunity 2: Telemedicine for Underserved Rural Communities
Opportunity Description:
Many rural areas lack access to quality healthcare services. Telemedicine 
can bridge this gap, providing medical consultation and treatment remotely.
Evaluation:
â¢ 
How it works: Establish telemedicine centers in rural communities and 
connect them with healthcare professionals via video conferencing and
remote monitoring devices. Patients can consult doctors, get 
prescriptions, and access medical advice without traveling long 
distances.
This improves access to healthcare, reduces healthcare costs, and can lead to early 
diagnosis and treatment.
Opportunity 3: Sustainable Agriculture through Vertical Farming
Opportunity Description:
Traditional farming methods often face challenges related to climate change 
and land scarcity. Vertical farming can provide a sustainable solution.
Evaluation:
â¢ 
How it works: Utilize indoor vertical farming systems with controlled 
environments, LED lighting, and hydroponics/aeroponics to grow crops 
in stacked layers. This technology minimizes the need for large areas 
of arable land and reduces water consumption.
â¢ 
Implementation: Set up vertical farming facilities near urban areas to 
reduce transportation costs. Partner with local restaurants and markets
to sell fresh produce. Invest in energy-efficient technologies.
â¢ 
Feasibility: Feasibility depends on the initial investment, market demand, 
and the availability of skilled labor.
This increases food production in urban areas, reduces the environmental footprint, and
ensures a constant supply of fresh, locally grown produce.
Opportunity 4: AI-Powered Personalized Education
Opportunity Description:
â¢ 
Implementation: Partner with local healthcare providers and 
governments to set up telemedicine centers. Ensure high-speed 
internet connectivity in these areas. Train healthcare workers and 
patients on how to use the technology.
â¢ 
Feasibility: Feasibility depends on the availability of internet 
infrastructure, regulatory approvals, and healthcare provider 
participation.
The education sector can benefit from personalized learning solutions, as 
traditional one-size-fits-all teaching methods may not cater to the unique 
needs of each student.
Evaluation:
â¢ 
How it works: Develop an AI-driven platform that analyzes students' 
learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses. It then tailors educational 
content and teaching methods to individual students, allowing them to 
learn at their own pace.
â¢ 
Implementation: Collaborate with schools and educational institutions to 
integrate the platform into their curriculum. Provide training to 
teachers and students on how to use the technology effectively.
â¢ 
Feasibility: Feasibility depends on the availability of technology 
infrastructure in schools, educational policies, and teacher acceptance.
Personalized education improves learning outcomes, increases student engagement, 
and prepares students for the future with customized skills and knowledge.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MG,1,Fall,AI,13,"Question: Can you please give me four worldly problems with solutions?

problem 1: climate change- Climate change is causing rising global temperatures, more frequent and severe weather events, and long-term environmental damage. The main solution to this issue is implement policies and regulations to promote energy efficiency and sustainable transportation. This solution will make the biggest difference because it effects the most people and therefore if everyone follows it, the issue will signifcantly decrease.

problem 2: hunger and foos insecurity- Many people around the world suffer from hunger and lack access to nutritious food. The main solution for this issue is to support food distribution programs and food banks to provide immediate relief to those in need. There are several people who struggle with this but there are also several people who don't and would be able to help.

problem 3: Access to clean water- Millions of people lack access to clean and safe drinking water, leading to health issues and waterborne diseases. The main way we can help this problem is to invest in infrastructure for clean water supply and sanitation in underserved regions. Althought this takes a lot of money so you would need someone whowho would be willing to loan money and help out with the costs of these things.

problem 4: Education inequality-  Educational opportunities are not equally accessible to all, resulting in a lack of skills and opportunities for marginalized communities. The main solution for this issue is provide equal access to quality education for all children, regardless of their socio-economic status. This can become a struggle when you get into not great cities and they struggle to get out of that city because they don't get a good enough education to be able to get a job and leave so it is just a repeatinf cycle.",,,,,,,,Don't forget to rank them in the future.,,,
JH,1,Fall,AI,13,"
Chat GPT input: 4 daily problems that can be solved by entrepreneurial ventures
Chat GPT output:
1. 
Transportation and Mobility: Problem: Congestion, pollution, and limited transportation options 
in urban areas can make commuting a daily hassle. Solution: Entrepreneurs can develop 
innovative transportation solutions such as ride-sharing apps, electric scooters, autonomous 
vehicles, or public transportation enhancements to improve mobility and reduce environmental 
impact.
2. 
Healthcare Access: Problem: Limited access to quality healthcare services and long waiting times
can be a significant issue, particularly in underserved areas. Solution: Healthcare startups can 
provide telemedicine services, on-demand healthcare apps, and medical clinics in remote 
locations, improving access to healthcare and reducing the burden on traditional healthcare 
systems.
3. 
Food and Nutrition: Problem: Finding healthy, convenient, and affordable food options can be a 
challenge, especially for busy individuals. Solution: Entrepreneurs can create meal delivery 
services, subscription-based meal kits, or restaurant aggregator platforms that offer nutritious 
and convenient food choices to consumers.
4. 
Environmental Sustainability: Problem: Climate change, pollution, and resource depletion are 
pressing global concerns that affect our daily lives. Solution: Entrepreneurial ventures can 
develop eco-friendly products, renewable energy solutions, waste reduction technologies, and 
recycling innovations to address environmental issues and promote sustainability.
I think the most innovative example from the ChatGPT output is the one promoting healthcare 
access. Reigning from a small town myself, I know firsthand how hard it can be to receive proper 
healthcare unless you live in a big city. You often must drive miles, sometimes hours, to get the 
adequate care you need depending on the emergency at hand. I believe opening medical clinics 
closer to smaller towns as well as implementing apps that have virtual appointments would be a 
great step forward to give more access to medical care for everyone. I think there is a solid market 
for this because of all the small/medium cities with a lack of healthcare professionals within reach. I 
think the profitability of these types of apps/clinics would add up over time as they became well 
known within the general area. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
NN,1,Fall,AI,13,"I typed in, ""Develop 4 unique business ideas for people who like to run""

Running Retreat Organizer: Create a business that organizes running retreats in picturesque locations. Offer multi-day packages that include guided trail runs, running workshops, yoga sessions, and healthy meal plans. Running enthusiasts can escape their daily routines and immerse themselves in a running-focused vacation experience. Partner with local hotels, resorts, and wellness instructors to provide a comprehensive retreat package.-- I think that this is a really great idea and probably my favorite out of the four. A lot of people who enjoy running also enjoy hiking, nature, and travel. This is something that I personally love a lot. Travel has always been a passion of mine, and me & my teammates/running friends frequently go on trips out west to run, hike, and train. I think other people would be interested in this opportunity. 

Personalized Running Apparel Design: Start a business that specializes in creating custom running apparel and accessories. Allow customers to design their own unique running gear, from personalized running shoes to custom-printed performance clothing. You can use 3D printing technology and high-quality materials to create bespoke products tailored to individual runners' preferences.--- I think this is creative idea. Although, I believe there are a lot of businesses out there already that do this, so it would probably be a fairly competitive market. I think what would set it apart would be offering high quality material/clothing, I feel like a lot of the personalized brands use pretty cheap/not very sustainable materials, so using high quality material could set it apart from other brands. 

Running Event Tech Services: Create a company that offers technology services for running events. Develop apps and software for race management, participant registration, live tracking, and results reporting. You can also offer RFID timing solutions, digital marketing services, and event photography to race organizers, helping them streamline and enhance their events. -- I think that this is a really good idea, because so many races/events need people to time the races and results. I have some friends who are coaches that have their own race timing company and it is very successful! They travel all over Michigan to time races, so I  think this would be a good business to go into! 

Virtual Running Challenge Platform: Create an online platform that hosts virtual running challenges, races, and events. Participants can join from anywhere in the world, complete the challenges at their own pace, and earn rewards for their achievements. Partner with brands and sponsors to provide prizes and build a community around your platform. Offer various challenges, from virtual marathons to unique themes, and engage runners through an interactive and competitive online environment. -- This is a unique idea, however, I don't think it's something I would be interested in pursuing. I like to do events like this in person rather than virtually, because the environment is just so different. I love the in-person interaction at races (ironic I say this since this is an online course), nevertheless, I just think runners enjoy the in-person events and races more than the virtual ones. 

These business ideas cater to the running community's passion for the sport and can be both profitable and fulfilling for those who enjoy running and want to turn their passion into a business.

to clean up public spaces can create a cleaner, more attractive environment and foster a sense 
of community pride.
Evaluation: This opportunity addresses a common issue in many communities. While not 
entirely unique, your innovative approach in organizing regular clean-up events and involving 
community members can make it special.
Assessment: Start by scheduling clean-up events and engaging with community members. 
Track the number of participants, measure the amount of trash collected, and collect feedback 
on the effectiveness of the initiative. Aim to achieve a certain level of community involvement 
and cleaner public spaces.

they are both something that I feel would be beneficial to me and many other people and are 
actually realistic/feasible. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
CR,0,Fall,AI,13,"4 new business ideas yet to be explored.

1.Skill-Based Learning Platform for Kids

Develop an online platform that focuses on teaching kids valuable life skills and hobbies in a fun and interactive way. Offer courses and workshops in areas like coding, creative arts, gardening, cooking, and problem-solving. Utilize gamification techniques to engage children and make learning enjoyable. Parents can track their child's progress and achievements, creating a supportive and educational online community.

I dont know how innovative this is but I do think an idea like this could be really beneficial. Getting kids involved in activites and or participating in there community is clinicly proven to be good for children especially at a young age. This is also something that can benefit children for the sole fact that it helps improve there skills and teaches them valuable everyday tasks and oppurtunities. I think this is a uinque idea I believe that Parents would look into something like this. Everything about this would be beneficial to children. Im sure something like this already exists but you could do it in a new improved innovative way.

2. Virtual Reality (VR) Tourism Experience

Launch a virtual reality tourism platform that allows users to explore various destinations and landmarks from the comfort of their homes. Partner with travel agencies, museums, and historical sites to create immersive VR experiences that provide users with a sense of actually being at the location. Offer guided virtual tours, interactive historical reenactments, and language immersion experiences, catering to both individual users and educational institutions looking to enhance their curriculum with virtual travel experiences.

Chatgpt tends to love VR. Its innovative for sure, It seems like a cool concept that could be really cool for alot of people and it would be a really fun expirience. However ive done something like this, which means that it already exists, Dont get me wrong it was a blast. In order to make this business succeed however you would need to have better technology better graphics and ultimatley make it more immersive than any of the competetors. This is something that could be a fun expirience but where is the market for it?

3. Eco-Friendly Packaging Solutions

Start a business that offers eco-friendly packaging alternatives to businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact. Develop and sell biodegradable, compostable, or reusable packaging materials made from sustainable sources. Offer consulting services to companies to help them transition from traditional packaging to environmentally friendly options, thereby promoting eco-conscious practices.

I just researched to see if anything like this exists and i am shocked that there is nothing like this. I think an oppurtunity like this is amazing, I think this is both unique and innovative and there is a very enormous market for it, especially with the need for helpingb the envirement. There is also so much room for growth in a company like this. What if eventually you were able to create your own delivery service as a whole and end up being one of the top delivery services around the world competing with FedEx and Amazon. I believe this idea is actually genius and I would honestly consider a business such as this one with the proper investors.

4.Personalized Home Decor and Interior Design Service

Create a business that provides personalized home decor and interior design services. Utilize technology such as augmented reality (AR) to allow customers to visualize how different furniture pieces and decorations would look in their homes before making a purchase. Offer a subscription service where customers receive curated decor items based on their preferences and the latest design trends, creating a hassle-free and enjoyable home decorating experience.

This is super cool, but it already exists. I saw my mom buy a rug the other day and she was able to use AR. Personlized interior designers are also one of the most known careers right now. HGTV has about 4 shows based on just personalized interior designers. So while its a great idea its nor innovative or unique in anyway and while it could be a money maker, you would have to be able to bring something to the table your competetors arent able to. That is hard enough as it is already.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
AR,0,Fall,AI,13,"I asked chat gpt to give me 4 different business opportunities and to explain them in detail. 


First one I got was the virtual wellness program. This idea would be a video source type and would be able to have yoga videos and meditation type of stuff.I think this idea could work but I feel that it could be played out and many other people have done it. 

Was a dropshipping business, this means instead of having your items in store you would have a partnership with a supplier and only need to fulfill certain orders. I honestly don't know how I feel about this specific idea. I'm honestly not very familiar with how it works. 

My second idea was a food truck business and it is very self explanatory. I do like this idea though, this idea works well if you have 2 things. First would be a very populated area that has a solid nightlife and place to sell. I also think that this would be a better idea if you already had money to use so you wouldn't have to work there all day and night. Instead have a crew and just pay them. 

This idea was a digital marketing agency, this gives ideas on social media and search engine optimization. This idea is also self explanatory but again i'm not a huge fan of this idea. First because I think if you have a good product that it would be easy to market it. Second, using athletes or other influencers is the best way to grow your audience.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MS,0,Fall,AI,13,"Prompt: Generate 4 ideas and a unique solution that a person would experience throughout the day.

Problem 1: Problem: Difficulty in Finding Parking in Urban Areas Solution: An AI-powered parking app that uses real-time data to guide users to available parking spots in their vicinity, reducing the time spent searching for parking spaces and minimizing traffic congestion.

Problem 2: Problem: Overwhelm from Social Media Notifications Solution: A personalized notification manager that uses machine learning to filter and prioritize social media notifications based on user preferences, ensuring users only receive the most relevant and timely updates.

Problem 3: Problem: Inefficient Grocery Shopping Experience Solution: A smart shopping list app that organizes items by aisle in the user's preferred grocery store, allowing for quick and efficient in-store shopping experiences, while also suggesting healthier alternatives based on dietary preferences.

Problem 4: Problem: Lack of Motivation for Physical Exercise Solution: A gamified fitness app that turns exercise routines into interactive games, providing rewards and achievements to motivate users to stay consistent with their workouts, and enabling them to compete with friends and other users for added motivation.

Assessment:

Parking Solution: This addresses a common urban problem and leverages technology to provide a practical and time-saving solution. It could potentially have a broad user base, especially in densely populated areas.

Notification Manager: This solution targets the issue of information overload from social media, which is a prevalent concern for many users. It uses machine learning to customize the notifications, which adds a unique and innovative touch.

Smart Shopping List: This addresses the everyday hassle of grocery shopping, providing a convenient solution for users. The feature of suggesting healthier alternatives adds a beneficial aspect to the app.

Gamified Fitness App: This solution tackles the motivation issue in exercise, which is a common challenge for many individuals. The gamification element could make it stand out and potentially attract a wide audience, especially those looking for a more engaging fitness experience.


I like the first idea of using AI to find a parking spot. Nowadays AI is pretty much taking over everything so why not use it to help find a parking spot? I went down to the MSU game today to hang out with my cousin and I had a hard time finding a parking spot. Having AI help find open spots would be useful.

ChatGPT had a lot to say with that broad of a question. 


One thing was an introduction to who I am with my style of photography. I donât think that is super helpful because all my clients receive an investment guide for them to pick out their package and in that I go into detail about who I am and my style of photography.


A few of the things that ChatGPT suggested, like a breakdown of pricing are things that go in my investment guide that introduces me and my photography to my clients. 


It did say to include a sample wedding timeline. I think that is helpful to include. It also suggested a sample family photo shot list. Those are things that a lot of brides struggle to create so I think it will be helpful for me, someone who has photographed 30+ weddings to include.

All of the opportunities that were generated were more âbig pictureâ and therefore pretty vague. I
included the output (first) as well as my own interpretation for a specific business opportunity.
(second)
The Opportunities:
1. The Output: âEducation and EdTechâ / An educational program based in low income
towns/cities that focus on teaching life lessons and skills: technological skills, English
language, etc..
a. Online and offline educational resources for remote areas.
b. Vocational training and skills development programs.
c. EdTech solutions for digital learning.
d. Educational infrastructure development.
2. The Output: âAffordable Housingâ / Transitional housing (apartment/condo style)
specifically for young adults attending university to help get them on their feet so they
can get a(n) (earlier) headstart.
a. Affordable housing construction and development.
b. Sustainable building materials and technologies.
c. Micro-mortgage and housing finance services.
d. Slum upgrading and urban development projects.
3. The Output: âE-commerce and Marketplacesâ Online marketplace where local artisans
can have access to foreign markets and vice versa. Eventually this can expand to all third
world countries in an effort to increase empathy, available resources, and improve the
economy.

a. Online marketplaces connecting local producers to global markets.
b. E-commerce logistics and delivery services.
c. Digital payment solutions for small businesses.
d. Access to wider customer bases through the internet.
4. The Output: âWomenâs and Youth Empowermentâ Extracurricular program(s) aimed at
teaching/celebrating girls and young women. Another option that I favor a bit more is
developing, selling, and implementing a curriculum for classrooms that teach more
extensive views and beliefs on the roles of women in society.
a. Skill development and entrepreneurship programs.
b. Gender-inclusive businesses and support services.
c. Youth mentorship and employment opportunities.
d. Women and youth cooperatives.
I really do like all of these opportunities that ChatGPT generated for this prompt, however none
of them were very innovative ideas. I think they were a bit more self explanatory. I will say that
it could be a fault of my own and the prompt that I used. In addition, this is a big problem and
therefore requires big solutions. In an attempt to make these opportunities-and the solution-seem
a bit more attainable, I put my own, specific twist on each. While I wouldnât say any of these
were unique ideas before my specifications, there doesnât seem to be anything similar that
preexists. Iâve never heard of any programs/businesses/companies that are like any of these
opportunities. In addition, I do really think that these business opportunities could truly benefit
the South African community. After being in South Africa, I can say that Iâve seen firsthand how
these businesses/companies would benefit the local people. Iâm also hesitant because these all
seem like non profit organization ideas. From a business standpoint Iâm not sure if any of these
opportunities would be great endeavors for someone looking to make money or to sell a
product/service. Iâm sure there would be great payoffs in the long term scheme of things, and
that definitely doesnât turn me off, butâ¦",,,,,,,,So what kinds of prompt might bring more innovative ideas? Or could you now add your twist and ask for alternative ideas with an additional prompt?,,,
ZT,1,Fall,AI,13,"
Prompt: What are 4 problems and solutions about college life?
Problem 1: Academic Stress
Solution: Time Management and Study Skills Workshops
â Many college students experience stress due to academic demands. To address
this, colleges can offer time management workshops and study skills sessions to
help students better organize their schedules and improve their study habits.
â Analysis: I feel like this is one thing that Central Michigan Univeristy is missing,
there is so much to do on CMUâs smaller campus however it can be hard for new
students, i.e. Freshman to understand how exactly to handle life, school, work,
social, and their general health without some sort of workshop or trial and error.
With trial and error this sacrifices a lot of studnets dropping out of school due to
the stress which negatively impacts the university in the long run. However I think
this is the msain problem many universities struggle with. I do not find this
solution unique or unthough of as it has been brought uo in my classes in the
more recent years however I do think the solution ChatGPT gave was a very
strong one.
Problem 2: Financial Strain
Solution: Financial Education and Scholarships
â High tuition costs and living expenses can put financial strain on college
students. Colleges can provide financial education programs to teach students
how to budget and manage their finances effectively. Additionally, offering
scholarships and financial aid can ease the burden.
â Analysis: Budget planning is a wonderful idea especially for students who
commute and have to spend that extra money on gas, rent, food etc that is
âincludedâ with living in the dorms for college students. I feel like not just
commuters will benefit from these classes as these financial classes will be a life
long lesson on how to and when to spend your own money as budgeting cand
saving can be very hard for some people without seeing it written out in front of
their faces. I do think this is more of a unique solution ChatGPT has given as I
know everyone financially struggles on campus but there hasnt been much talk
on exactly how to deal with it other than joke about it and call it a day.
Problem 3: Mental Health and Well-being
Solution: Counseling Services and Mental Health Support
â College life can be emotionally challenging. To support students' mental health,
colleges can provide accessible counseling services, create awareness
campaigns, and offer resources for stress management and mental health
support.

â Analysis: Since CMU already has counseling on campus I would say this isnât an
original idea however I do find that couseling on CMUâs campus is always filled
up by the first week of school, especially after the pandemic. With mental health
ebing the main reason why many drop out whether it be from anxiety, depression,
or the stress of it all it all boils down to the mental health of the student.
Problem 4: Diversity and Inclusion
Solution: Inclusive Policies and Awareness Initiatives
â Many colleges face issues related to diversity and inclusion. Implementing
inclusive policies, promoting diversity awareness, and creating a welcoming
environment for students from all backgrounds can help build a more inclusive
college community.
â Analysis: This is an excellent problem and solution concept however I feel like now
days there isnât really a lack of diversity and inclusion anymore as many institutions have
put out DEIB programs for the campus as a whole and have year round programs
depending on the time of the year. I donât think this is a very original idea from ChatGPT
due to the fact that this is what our society is hyperficussed on, so this is always being
talked about.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

Itâs hands on guidance and communication to help someone learn more about whatâs in their kitchen and how to use it to their benefit. Iâd really care about these projects because I would be working with and advising people through a craft I love. It would probably take a couple years, community events, and followers to gain traction for these projects.


Opportunity #2

I always cook on a budget and I know many others who do too. Cooking on a budget can be super stressful when living paycheck to paycheck. I wish there was a cheap cooking type of cook book geared towards students and people living paycheck to paycheck. What entrepreneurial opportunities lie within this idea?

Creating a buget friendly cookbook and creating a YouTube channel for budget cooking seems like the best options to go with. It would take a couple of years to put a book together or to make enough videos for a YouTube channel, but I think Iâd care enough to stick to these projects. Helping myself and people with food insecurity would be so rewarding.


Opportunity #3

I love being a part of the gay community but I think that there are only really specific services and events that are offered that only apply to certain types of gay people. This can be crushing to people who want to be involved in the community, but specific types of events donât always 100% welcome their identity (like drag or specific sexual orientation/gender groups). Iâve dreamed about opening up a place for queer people who come from all walks of life. What enttreprenurial opportunities could come from this idea? 


Chat GPTâs Response:

Creating a space that caters to the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community is a fantastic idea. Your vision for a place that welcomes individuals from all walks of life within the queer community opens up numerous entrepreneurial opportunities. Here are some ideas:

Inclusive LGBTQ+ Community Center:

Establish an inclusive community center that serves as a hub for various LGBTQ+ activities, support groups, events, and resources. Ensure that the center is welcoming to people of all identities and backgrounds.

Queer-Inclusive CafÃ© or Bar:

Open a queer-inclusive cafÃ© or bar that provides a safe and welcoming space for individuals of diverse backgrounds. Host events, drag shows, and performances that represent the spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities.

Offer workshops and training sessions for businesses, schools, and organizations on LGBTQ+ diversity and inclusion. Provide resources and guidance on creating inclusive environments for everyone.

Queer-Owned Retail Store:

Open a retail store that sells products from queer-owned businesses and artists. Showcase a wide range of items that reflect the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community.

All-Inclusive LGBTQ+ Events:

Organize events that celebrate the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community. This could include pride festivals, art exhibits, and cultural events that represent various identities and experiences.

LGBTQ+ Travel Services:

Create a travel agency that specializes in LGBTQ+ travel experiences. Offer inclusive travel packages to destinations that are welcoming to all members of the queer community.

Mental Health and Wellness Center:

Establish a mental health and wellness center that offers counseling, therapy, and support groups specifically tailored to the LGBTQ+ community. Ensure that the services are inclusive and sensitive to diverse experiences.

Queer Bookstore and Library:

Open a queer bookstore and library that features literature, art, and resources from LGBTQ+ creators. Create a space for readings, discussions, and community gatherings.

Inclusive LGBTQ+ Dating App:

Develop a dating app that prioritizes inclusivity and diversity within the LGBTQ+ community. Implement features that cater to different identities, interests, and relationship preferences.

Queer-Inclusive Fitness Center:

Establish a fitness center that caters to the diverse needs of the LGBTQ+ community. Offer inclusive fitness classes, wellness programs, and recreational activities.

Online Queer-Owned Marketplace:

Create an online marketplace that features products exclusively from queer-owned businesses. This can include a variety of goods, from fashion and art to home dÃ©cor and beauty products.

LGBTQ+ Educational Programs:

Develop educational programs and workshops that focus on LGBTQ+ history, culture, and issues. Collaborate with schools, universities, and organizations to promote understanding and inclusion.

Cultural Exchange Events:

Organize events that facilitate cultural exchanges within the LGBTQ+ community. This could involve art exhibitions, food festivals, and performances that showcase the diversity of queer cultures.

Queer-Inclusive Podcast or Media Outlet:

Start a podcast or media outlet that amplifies the voices and stories of individuals from all backgrounds within the LGBTQ+ community. Cover a broad range of topics to ensure inclusivity.

When pursuing these entrepreneurial opportunities, it's essential to prioritize inclusivity, representation, and sensitivity to the diverse experiences within the LGBTQ+ community. Consider collaborating with individuals from different backgrounds to ensure your initiatives are truly representative and welcoming to all.

Analysis:

The idea Iâm most interested in would be a queer inclusion cafe or bar. This sounds like a dream to open up. However, it needs to be in a location where there is a bigger LGBTQ+ population to be a success (like Grand Rapids or Detroit). I would really care about this project and I assume it would take a year or two to gain traction and get the right attention.



Opportunity #4

After college I want to try out performance type jobs before I get a job that has to do with my broadcast and cinematic arts major.

The diverse experiences will likely contribute to your creativity and adaptability in the field of media and broadcasting.

Analysis: 

I like the ideas where I would become a street performer or participate in an online talent marketplace. I could really build up a reputation doing either of these. I could also lose everything and not make any money. It would take a couple years to gain traction, but itâs also a huge risk. I would really care about these projects, but Iâm afraid they wouldnât succeed.

BW,1,Fall,AI,13,"I asked Chat to give me solutions/ opportunities to losing or misplacing silverware because it happens a lot in my household. This is what it gave me:

Smart Silverware Organizers: Develop smart organizers that use Bluetooth or RFID technology to track the location of each piece of silverware. An accompanying mobile app can help users easily locate misplaced items, ensuring they are always at hand when needed.

Silverware with Embedded Tracking: Create silverware sets with built-in tracking technology, such as RFID chips or QR codes. When users misplace a piece, they can scan or use an app to quickly identify its location within their home.

Augmented Reality (AR) Silverware Locator: Develop an AR application that, when used with AR glasses or a smartphone, can guide users to their misplaced silverware by overlaying visual cues or a virtual trail leading to the item's location.

Silverware Subscription Services: Offer a subscription-based service where users receive a regular supply of disposable or biodegradable silverware. This eliminates the issue of misplacing reusable silverware altogether, as they can simply dispose of it after use and receive new utensils with each meal.

I simply do not like nay of these answers because they do not address losing the silverware and ways to retain them. I can entertain the subscription service, but I do not feel there is a niche audience for that. I believe a more innovative way to hold onto silverware is create magnetic silver ware that automatically clings to each other. Because it is so easy to lose one spoon, but the fork and the spoon? There's no way. I think I could put a magnet on the base of the spoon or fork and then sell as that, so they do not become misplaced. ",,,,,,,,Good points.,,,
MA,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"I think what I need to try doing is expanding my interests and hobbies so I notice more things that I could fix, meaning if I right now can only focus on what interests me and I can only look for solutions for the things I am focused on, if my interests and hobbies are widened then I can increase the width of my focus.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MB,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"This week I listened to the podcast episode titled âOpportunity IdentificationâBrian 
Gramm.â It offered some very interesting insights on how to identify opportunities and decide 
which business concepts are worth pursuing and which ones should be left alone. These insights 
include deciding whether I would buy my own product and what is the ultimate size of the 
market thatâd Iâd be selling in. When deciding whether to pursue a business opportunity, itâs 
important to consider not only if other people will buy your product, but also if you personally 
will buy your product. You should create a business that you believe in and not just one that will 
make you money so that you will have the highest rate of wanting to be successful. Throughout 
this week this was one of my criteria for considering whether I would pursue a business, because 
if it doesnât interest me, I donât think Iâd be the best person for creating the business. 
Determining the ultimate size of a market is also very important so that you can maximize the 
amount of people you're selling to. The fact that Brian Gramm could sell the same product to 
tailgaters as those who suffer from natural disasters just goes to show the range of consumers a 
single product can cover. This is something that I need to work on when looking for 
opportunities so that I know the true range of a product so that I donât miss out on any 
opportunities.",,,,,,,,Nice! I look forward to seeing you consider multiple markets.,,,

For the weekly reflection of week #2, I have decided to listen to the podcast with Brian 
Brasch. Right from the beginning, he expresses how in his lifetime he has started about ten 
businesses. Emotions I felt during this statement is that he must have no time for anything else 
going on in his life because he is such a busy entrepreneur. He also expresses that his ideas just 
come from daily life problems. I can relate to this statement because of the problems/solutions 
we have been submitting for the last two weeks in this course. It is motivating to hear from this 
podcast that real life entrepreneurs have started businesses just from daily struggles they 
experience in life on a daily basis. Before this class, I always thought entrepreneurs thought 
about the business they wanted to create for years. This entrepreneur Brian Brasch has made it 
clear that it is possible to create your own business about anything that an individual is 
passionate about or struggles with in their lifespan. 
Noticing opportunities for this entrepreneur has been eye opening for me while listening 
to this episode. He claimed that while he was in college, that he went to a T-shirt shop and he 
was ready to walk out because nothing in there seemed interesting enough for him to purchase. 
Brian claimed that a very trained salesperson inside of the store knew what they were doing 
when it came to making sales and having a good business. He also claimed that the shirts were 
unique and different from other brands because they included special products to make the T-
shirts unique and different from others. This great employee inside of the store made him realize 
that great employees make a difference. Having trained individuals that work for your company 
will make your business or brand more successful and that is what this entrepreneur learned from
this experience. 
The last key factor I have picked up from this entrepreneur is learning about how 
important ROI (return on investment) is within having your own company. The return on 
investment is the ratio of net profit over the total cost of investment, so basically what you earn 
as an entrepreneur after the sale. All entrepreneurs want to earn a high income with the business 
they create. However, earning a profit that fits your lifestyle and needs is important as well. Most
of the time when you speak to an entrepreneur, they do not speak about such things as return on 
investment because it can get personal quick. I can relate to this entrepreneur because I have 
always overshared with general things in my life and are not afraid to speak about topics such as 
this. I really value this entrepreneur for speaking on this because it is an important part of owning
your own or multiple businesses. ",,,,,,,,Great analysis.,,,
BC2,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"This week went a lot smoother than last week because I looked around for ideas more often. 
This week I want to contribute more things from the podcast like putting yourself in positions for 
opportunity. For example, sitting in the dorm gives you a very low chance of finding opportunity but, if 
you were to go for a walk, or go to an event somewhere, you will have a higher chance of finding 
opportunity. Also, I learned that you need to always be looking for opportunity because a lot of things go
right over peopleâs heads. This up-and-coming week I want to look harder, and try to get out more to 
events so I have a higher chance of finding opportunity. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
JC,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"
I've been working on re-training my mindset to think more entrepreneurially, and 
it's been a journey of self-discovery and growth. One of the key aspects I've found 
relatively easy is recognizing opportunities. I've become more adept at spotting potential
areas for innovation, whether it's in my own field or in daily life. It's exciting to see how 
small changes can lead to significant opportunities. However, I've also noticed that I 
struggle with taking action on these opportunities. While I can identify them, the actual 
implementation feels challenging. It's about overcoming the fear of failure and the 
uncertainty that comes with trying something new. It's not just about having the idea; it's
about having the confidence to act on it. To address this, I've been actively seeking out 
experienced entrepreneurs and listening to their podcasts to understand how they think 
and what they do when faced with challenges. What stands out is their resilience and 
ability to embrace failure as a stepping stone to success. They also emphasize the 
importance of a strong network and seeking mentorship.
In the coming week, I want to try and implement what I've learned from these 
entrepreneurs. Specifically, I want to work on my confidence in taking action on 
opportunities and start building a network of like-minded individuals who can provide 
guidance and support. Developing an entrepreneurial mindset has already started to 
impact other aspects of my education and life. I'm more open to taking risks and 
exploring new paths. It's a mindset that not only applies to business but also to personal
growth and problem-solving. I'm excited to see how this journey continues to shape my 
thinking and actions.",,,,,,,,Even if taking action is only15 minutes of the first step-do that.,,,
MD,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"For this assignment, I chose to listen to Derrin Hillâs interview on the Business Model. One part that really stuck out to me was when Hill was talking about his company Rev Road. He spoke about how forming his business had lots of highs and lows. This resonated with me because I have been doing video editing since I was eleven, but Iâve had lots of doubts at different points in my life on whether or not I should pursue it as a career. I started with video production as my major, and then doubted it so much that I went through five other majors before coming back to it again. Itâs comforting to hear that successful entrepreneurs have had struggles with wondering whether or not their passion would actually work out in the real world. 

Realizing this over the past few months has helped me feel a lot more confident in my work, because I know that itâs okay to not always know if what youâre doing will work, but remaining passionate regardless.",,,,,,,,The secret is in the daily grind,,,
RG,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"Throughout the first two weeks of this class, I've realized that developing an entrepreneurial attitude has been an interesting and challenging experience. I have had a fantastic opportunity to learn about creativity, being more alert, and problem-solving thanks to this course. It has provided me with an avenue to turn my concepts into viable opportunities and has challenged me to think outside the box. Although I am an accounting major, I have also seen how my different areas of study can have an effect on my attention to detail, especially from my time in communication and philosophy classes,

I anticipate that this course will push me harder and allow me to strengthen my creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. I have also found that the entrepreneurial attitude I'm building is a form of thinking that can be used in any area of life, not simply starting a business.",,,,,,,,Two of the podcast are with people that majored in accounting,,,
MG,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"Business Model Podcast:

What we have been working on in these past weeks is trying to look at the world in a different lense. He talks about looking at everything as a potential opportunity. I think soemtimes I struggle with this mainly when something bad has happened. I normally am upset for a little while and then turn around and think about it in the right way which is thinking about what I can learn from this experience and how I can turn it into something better and something that I can use. It is being more engaged at times in my life not always just trying to get through the day. 

I think if I start to think about things that way more often I will not only save time because I am not wasting time thinking about the bad part of things, but I will also be happier. If you have more of a positive outlook on life, then you are more likely to be happier do more things get more things done along with putting yourself in a position to experience more opportunity.

In the podcast episode I watched which centered around return on investment, the guest 
speaker spoke about honing in on your passions and seeing what entrepreneurial ventures came out of 
it. Being aware of your passions will help you have an easier time of sticking to an idea and running with 
it, even through uncertainty or trial and error. The speaker also talked about purposely trying to build 
upon those entrepreneurial and salesperson skills as not all businesses have someone to specifically sell 
those products and miss out on business opportunities. This stuck to me because it showed me those 
skills can be built upon over time and just because I do not have many of these skills right now does not 
have to be reality forever. After listening to the podcast, I want to try honing in on my passions and 
building upon my sales/entrepreneurship skills because I think this will help me to identify those 
problems and opportunities as well as their solutions in my life easier. 
In my opinion, I think my ability to identify problems has gotten easier over time. Like instead of 
analyzing my day at the end of the day to look for opportunities, Iâve been noticing them in the moment 
and writing down my responses throughout the day when possible. I think the hardest thing about 
noticing opportunities is simply the noticing part because after I notice them, I typically have no problem
running with it and coming up with a creative solution. My experiences have been good overall, except 
this week and especially this weekend I have been bedridden with illness, so it has been harder than 
usual to fully feel like I am developing my skills. My expectations for next week are higher because I have 
a feeling Iâll be mostly better by then and will be able to put my full effort into assignments. I also feel 
like I have been beginning to take these skills into my own life in thinking âwhat could this business be 
doing better?â or âis there a way I could improve this product or service to make it more marketable to 
consumers?â. ",,,,,,,,Great job! keep it up.,,,
NN,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"The podcast I listened to was Opportunities Processing with Adam Kaslikowski, founder of The Motoring Club. There were a lot of concepts discussing how his ideas are derived that I found really interesting. Kaslikowski talked about how his ideas come from his experience, and opportunities he has seen that have gone missed. It reminded me of our daily practices and how he have to think of ""opportunities,"" similar to what he talked about.  

He also talked us through his thought process when evaluating these ideas. He said, ""normally when I get pitched an idea my mind kind of rolls for a bit-- I think of this big expansion of all these other services, and if it's location based, all these other cities and where it could go."" I think creating a map or ""web"" of the the different kinds of services you can develop based off from one main idea is a really good opportunity to brainstorm and come up with something unique. Additionally, thinking of the other cities/locations where it could lead to is smart-- since you most likely want to optimize your business ideas growth the best that you can. 

He also discussed that looking at the next steps once you form your idea is important. ""What are the next 1,2,3 steps to get this out?"" Kaslikowski also highlighted how internal motivation is important to keep going. It's good to have a solid purpose to keep you going when things get difficult/tough. 

When talking about how far he looks out in terms of how quickly it can become big, he said, ""I never imagine an endpoint because the variability gets so wide the further you look out-- I normally think about where it could go in 5 years."" 

He also talked about ""niches"" too, which I think is an important concept. It's good to think about, ""This is where I have experience and what I'm good at."" What I understood from this is that if you are good at something whether it be music, art, fitness, culinary arts, crafting, sports, hunting, fishing, cars, technology, etc., why not take advantage of your knowledge in these concepts/activities and create services based on your own expertise? That's how a lot of successful businesses start. It's something I'm starting to think about more and how I can come up with ideas for services/products based on the things I am passionate about and love to do. 
",,,,,,,,Great analysis!,,,
KP,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"1. 
What is easy or hard about noticing opportunities so far?
Something that can be hard about noticing opportunities is the initial observation. I think the 
easiest part about noticing opportunity is once you come up with the initial problem or idea and
expanding it. It can also be hard to make sure the noticed opportunity is feasible and a solution 
that is unique. 
2. 
What do they do to do the things that feel hard to you?
The speaker said how he views the world as a potential opportunity. When he sees things, he 
will think if there is a bigger opportunity there and work his mind through what the product 
would be and determine if there is a market that will actually make money in. He sees what 
skills, contacts and finances are in that. We have been working on this but sometimes finding a 
opportunity can be difficult and I would like to get better at that and open my mind to finding 
more opportunities. 
3. 
Is there anything they demonstrated or modeled that you want to try doing this coming 
week? 
The speaker went through the process of how when he when he identifies a problem, he 
will not look at it as a problem but more as what money will flow through that problem. He 
discusses will someone buy a better version of it. Which is a really good way to look at that. 
He will figure out if there is money in it, by a likely and reasonable if he oversaw buying this 
would he buy this. It is usually a no, because putting himself in the situation such as âwould I
buy thisâ, puts it in a realistic and deeper thinking approach. This is an interesting way; he 
would put himself in various roles to see if he would buy it. I would like to start looking at 
opportunities and switching my mindset more on a better and more unique solution and 
what market it is in and how successfull be.

Write at least a paragraph or two regarding your experiences and expectations with 
developing your entrepreneurial mindset and any connections you've made to other 
aspects of your education or life.
My experiences and expectations with developing my entrepreneurship mindset started with 
thinking outside of the box and looking for problems, opportunities, and solutions. For example,
the daily assignments we have been doing in this class has really had me think from a different 
perspective. Observing people, and day to day activities and turning it into a solution and or 
opportunity was a big step into developing my mindset. Another example is in my ENT221 class,
Marketing Strategies for Entrepreneurs, I have learned many things such as more about learning
about the customer and different marketing opportunities. That has helped me learn a lot about
developing my entrepreneurship mindset and it has helped me think deeper into opportunities 
and look at certain products or solutions as a marketing opportunity. I find myself applying the 
creative problem-solving skills I've learned in my entrepreneurship classes to other academic

It's taught me to approach challenges and opportunities with resilience and adaptability, 
recognizing that problems can be a chance for growth",,,,,,,,Great work!,,,
MS,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"One thing I noticed that was different about this week than last week was focusing on opportunities to create a solution. Week one was a lot easier because I focused on the problem and did not think about a solution to those problems. This week I had to do a little more thinking. I had to sit down and take a few minutes to reflect on the opportunity I witnessed. I listened to a bit of Brian Gramm's podcast and I thought it was crazy how he said it takes him a few seconds to work out what product he could create for an opportunity he saw. Like I said it took me 5-10 minutes to think of solutions. A takeaway I got from Brian was that his outlook on products is ""If I was in charge of buying this kind of thing, would I buy this kind of thing?"" I like that way of thinking because it gets you into the shoes of a consumer. It makes you say to yourself, ""Would I buy this?"" ",,,,,,,,"Practice makes habit which speeds things up over time. Keep going, you'll get to Mr. Gramm's level.",,,
GS,1,Fall,Reflection,14," - I have noticed that throughout these daily assignments, I have noticed that I find myself paying more attention to little things and thinking about how I can better my business. 

One thing that he said in the podcast is that when someone brings and idea to him he thinks of it as âokay it will work if we do this and this and thisâ. I think that is a good way to think about a business idea when it comes to new ones. I could learn from that because I tend to get excited about an idea and run with it instead of looking at the details and the things I need to do to make it successful like he says to do. Adam Kaslikowksi talks about the instant gratification of paydays. He says that you can go work for someone and make money faster short-term but if essentially if you are willing to play the Long game, you can make more money by working for yourself and your own business. Of course that isnât always the case, not everyone is entrepreneurial but I resinated with him saying that because when I started with photography, I had a photographer ask me to work for her and she told me the money I would make and at the time, as a 16 year old, it seemed like a lot but in the end, it wasnât even 25% of what she was making off the session and I would be doing all the work. I think a good point that he essentially makes and to think about it that longterm is the best way to think. How will this benefit me long term and not just in the moment or short term.",,,,,,,,Nice analysis!,,,
MS2,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"What feels easy is the increasing ability to notice gaps or inefficiencies in my 
surroundings that could be addressed, and what feels challenging is perhaps prioritizing
and deciding which opportunities to pursue. Listening to Adam Kaslikowski's experience
in the podcast was enlightening. His willingness to explore ideas even when immediate 
excitement is lacking resonated with me. This mindset shift is powerful because it 
emphasizes that not every opportunity needs to spark instant passion; sometimes, 
motivation and commitment can drive success. This aligns with broader life experiences
where sustained effort and motivation often lead to significant accomplishments. I aim to
incorporate this mindset in the coming week, being open to opportunities that might not 
elicit immediate excitement but possess potential for growth and success. This aligns 
with the idea that consistent motivation and commitment can be powerful drivers in 
entrepreneurial endeavors.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
TS,0,Fall,Reflection,14,"I listened to the podcast about identifying different opportunities, and I don't think what he was talking about was difficult to do. Something that I would like to try and do that he talked about was asking the question, ""Would Ibuy this product? and then asking the same question from a different point of view.

I think so far, heading into week three, my entrepreneurial mindset is getting much better, and I'm starting to pick up on more opportunities much easier. I would defanilty like to start asking the questions he is asking himself, i think that would help me connect with the opportunity and try and figure whatt I like/dislike about it.

I am confident that my Daily Noticing Practices were much more efficient this week than
they were the first week I attempted it. I wouldnât say that the process has been easier but I do
believe that the problems/great experiences are coming to me faster than they did before. I did
struggle a bit when it came to figuring out solutions to each problem/great experience that I
encountered. This process in particular took me longer than the others. I do think that it makes
sense that this is the case because it was our first week of generating solutions to the
problems/great experiences we encountered.
I am curious to see if my brain automatically computes these solutions and opportunities
like they started to after last weekâs noticing practices. I do think that the design of these daily
practices is very beneficial because we started with the simplest aspect and this week we added
another step to layer our thinking. My guess is that next week, starting tomorrow, will be another
layering level that we will add to the processes we have already been practicing. This type of
learning benefits me because I am able to practice a step at a time and by the time it comes to
implementing the next, the previous is already automatic. Or at least more automatic than it was
before this class.
This week I also tried to pay attention to the great experiences around me, or the
opportunities for growth rather than the problems that need a solution. I hope to work on this
more next week as I think I made some improvements but Iâd say my mind still gravitates more
to the negative.",,,,,,,,Great analysis!,,,
BW,1,Fall,Reflection,14,"Now that I have been able to identify different opportunities everyday and see what isn't out there and what is has allowed me to be able to do the first part of entrepreneurship. Taking the risk is the second part that always leaves me stagnant because I am not sure if I have the resources or education to make it happen. Something that Brad said stuck out to me at the beginning of the podcast when he spoke on his story of how he was not able to navigate taking risks with the opportunities given because he also did not have the resources. This was really validating to hear that even in his journey, he has also become stagnant when it came to being able to take his ideas to the next level. These pasts few months, I have been in several rigorous business courses that have elevated my confidence in making decisions with my current venture and also being able to construct a new ones along the way. Overall, I feel that I am leading to where Brad was in that situation and I am curious to see what experiences come my way. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

MB,1,Fall,Observation,15," Part of my job as sound crew for Cabaret is cleaning the gunk off of actorâs mics after the

Gone soaks into my skin and makes it oily and tingly (I should probably be wearing gloves but am not

for the environment. My business idea is to make a product like Goo Gone but have it safe to use if it 
comes in contact with skin and made with biodegradable products so that itâs better for the 
environment. Goo Gone is a fairly common item used for many different tasks. My new product could 
be sold not only to theatre companies to help clean the gunk off headset mics, but also to teachers who
need to get gunk off classroom tables and desks or households that need to get tape off walls or other

MD,1,Fall,Observation,15,"For my first business opportunity I wanted to further expand on an idea that Iâve been developing over the last two weeks. It has to do with planners! As Iâve stated before, I am a big fan of planners, and often keep multiple at the same time, but I have had some major issues with the ones that Iâm using. It is frustrating to have issues with your planner, because when youâre not able to fully capitalize on the tool that is supposed to be keeping you the most organized and the most productive, it feels like more of a stressor than a tool! My solution is a business that can begin as an Etsy shop and then scale to something larger if it proves to be successful. The main draw of this shop would be that you can create a planner that is totally customizable. Anything from page thickness, to weekly layout, to cover design, to additional pages, you can customize it. The personalization aspect will be attractive to customers and profitable for the business because the more customizable the product, the more you can charge! I believe that the main audiences for this type of product would be dedicated planner users, considering they often have very particular tastes, and those that are looking to get more organized in their life. Etsy does a great job of introducing consumers to products that would add to their lifestyle quality, so Iâm confident that an Etsy listing would be a great place to gain a following for this product. This would likely be a product that people would buy multiple times, because you need a new planner every year!

Through spending a lot of time researching different roller coasters across the globe, I have learned a lot about the technical aspects of these machines. One thing that has interested me in particular recently, is roller coaster efficiency. I am interested in this topic because a great ride can become very frustrating for guests if it is constantly stopping and starting due to safety checks or issues. Roller coasters are insanely expensive for theme parks to build and maintain, and if youâre building something with such high stakes, you want to make sure that your riders are getting through the experience seamlessly. The problem that I want to dive into for the purpose of this assignment is daily inspections. Inspections are done by staff for the most part, which leaves room for error, and takes a good amount of time. My solution is to create a specialized inspection drone designed for maintenance and safety. These drones could be equipped with cameras, sensors, and more to ensure that the inspection process is seamless, and the downtime is lessened. The business could sell or rent these drones to theme parks for existing rides, or to help build the rides altogether. This could either be a one time purchase or a purchase that a theme park makes multiple times if they are renting. This technology could also apply to construction sites to help build structures!

MD,1,Fall,Observation,15,"For my last business opportunity of the day I wanted to focus on another, more consumer focused aspect of roller coasters, which are the lines! There have been a lot of complaints recently specifically geared towards Disney parks for their absurd wait times and poor crowd control. They have attempted to fix the problem by introducing online queues that guests can get in line for from their phones, but because of the large number of guests at the parks at one time, these queues crash, or are filled in seconds. This is a very frustrating experience for people who spent thousands to attend the parks. My solution to this problem would be in-line entertainment to keep guests engaged and entertained while going through the line. My business would be to work with theme parks to create engaging forms of entertainment using tools such as interactive displays and games, augmented reality experiences, photo opportunities and storytelling aspects to further increase theming, which makes the whole experience better. I would generate revenue through partnering with theme parks to design these queues alongside them. This could be a service that they use multiple times for different rides or experiences. The value that they would be paying for would be the ability to make their experiences more engaging for guests, and to avoid frustration of standing in a long boring line for hours at a time. If guests feel like they are having a positive experience just by standing in the line, it will keep them from feeling like theyâve been shortchanged.

foot-tall woman. I noticed the shoe size I needed was either always out of stock or simply did not exist 
on the website which was frustrating to say the least. I could tell there was a gap in shoe products 
available for women with larger shoe sizes. My solution to this would be to start up my own inclusive 
shoe size brand that goes from extremely small shoe sizes to way above average shoe sizes to make sure 
everybody has a shoe available for them. I would also ensure to make sure they were on trend to appeal 
to a lot of different groups of people, especially a teenage to young adult crowd. 2 groups who would be 
interested in this solution would be teenagers and young adults who have grown into their shoe size and 
are looking for a trendy, affordable, and inclusive size shoe brand. This obviously would not be an 
everyday purchase but a purchase every 3 to 6 months when in need of new shoes and I think these 
groups would be willing to pay at least 45 to 50 dollars since I still want it to be an affordable brand but 
less than 90 dollars.",,,,,,,,"Great job articulating prices, though make sure your customer groups are really different. For example, what is the difference in selling to teenagers versus young adults? Or popcorn enthusiasts and weirdos like you? Vegitarians and vegans? There are differences but how much would you have to change what or how you do things to meet their needs

JH,1,Fall,Observation,15," vegetarian meal kit â I am a vegetarian and I tend to struggle with finding the most healthy or tasty 
options in our campus dining hall. I often resort to eating stuff like ramen, protein bars, or just plain 
salads from the dining hall which isnât the greatest range of foods I should be keeping in rotation. It 
makes me frustrated, and I feel like my life would be easier if I subscribed to some sort of vegetarian 
health-based meal kit. So, this would be my solution, would be to start up my own vegetarian meal kit 
service that is centered around health and wellness and giving good food options to vegetarians and 
even vegans. As mentioned, 2 target audiences would be vegetarians and vegans because I feel like these
are underrepresented groups when it comes to availability of a good, healthy meal. I feel like this could 
be a monthly subscription that delivers every two weeks with like 5-10 different recipes to try out that 
serve 1-4 people. And then, however many people you select servings for would up the price. I think at a
minimum since this applies to underrepresented groups, they would be willing to pay more, Iâd say 
anywhere from 100-250 bucks per month for 10-20 recipes.",,,,,,,,"Great job articulating prices, though make sure your customer groups are really different.

JH,1,Fall,Observation,15," Popcorn that wonât burn â This is a little bit more of a niche problem but ever since I got sick last 
Thursday, I ended up eating around 3 bags of popcorn from then until now (Monday). I realized every 
time I would pop my popcorn I would either end up burning the bag to get every kernel popped or have 
non-burnt popcorn but would have additional kernels at the bottom of the bag. Iâm the type of person 
who wants to feel like Iâm getting the most bang for my buck, so having those extra kernels at the bottom
of the bag felt wrong to me. My solution: come up with a popcorn recipe that pops every kernel fully 
without burning the popcorn or without having extra kernels at the bottom of the bag. I think 2 groups 
this solution would appeal to would be popcorn advocates who enjoy it on regular basis as well as 
weirdos like me who are just very particular about getting the most out of the products they buy. I think 
people who buy these products may be okay with spending slightly more than the average popcorn box 
to get the most out of their popcorn, going at Iâd say a range of 12-14$ for a box of 6 packs. ",,,,,,,,"Great job articulating prices, though make sure your customer groups are really different.

NN,1,Fall,Observation,15,"During the winter time in Michigan, it's a pretty common problem for drivers to deal with snow piling up on their cars, especially when they don't move them for a long time. It can pile up fast and can be difficult to take off. I think a unique solution could be to come up with an instant-melting super speed type of technology designed on vehicles to automatically get off all of the snow. It's the worst when you're running late but then you have to brush all the snow off your car, which makes you even more late. I'm not quite sure how this technology could be designed, but perhaps there is some sort of scientific technology that is capable of doing it. Two groups/segments that might be interested in the solution would be 1. People in areas with lots of snow, and 2. Car companies. Car companies could pay engineers to come up with the plan for it. People in areas with lots of snow might be willing to pay for cars like this. If I had the money to get it, I would want to.

I know you can ask other people to make sure it is ""centered,"" but I think it would be neat if there was a device that could precisely center it on the wall for you. Maybe some type of laser light that points at the wall to line it up perfectly? It's a little far fetched, but some careers such as builders, architects, or interior deisgners might find it beneficial for their work because attention to detail is important to them. Or, people who live alone and don't have someone to ensure that their stuff isn't crooked on the wall. I think this device would mainly be used by people in the field of interior design, since most ""typical"" people probably wouldn't want to pay for this.

It would be cool if there was some sort of technology/material for waterbottles that could be implemented that prevents or doesn't allow mold growth at all.

The technology is there to provide a real time language translator, There are apps and softwares that can translate but you have to type it in and you cant neccasarilly speak into it and it gives you a real time translation on what you are hearing. Not only does nothing like this exist (yet) It can be something that could be huge benefit for people all around the world. You could go as far as to say that there is need for this type of technology. There are alot of ways you could go about this on how to make a profit, By devoloping the technology and selling it to another company, Or by making an app and either making it a specific price or make it free with adds. You could even try and partner with another high tech company to deliver a two for one business proposition to the public. Personally I would either try to partner with someone like google or apple and patent my technology, Or id sell it. I would do this because the need would be met around the world with a company that easily has the funds to provide this for everyone for free with a purchase of an apple or google device etc. This Is something that as an euntreprenuer you have to decide weather you would want some sort of incintive or drive up your price and let someone else deal with it - which is more my style.

someones driveway and has a safe place to be stored when not used. This also makes it
easier for dashers as the expensive of gas and maintenance on the car alone will help
keep them coming back to dash for Doordash. The company that would be involved

would be doordash however Ubereats could definitely get involved as well as they has
the similar set up. The only thing that would change for the public is the dashers as they
would have to drive to a lot then start dashing instead of just starting when they left their
house. This will also make it easier for the used of doordash to identify which car is
looking for their house as the companies logo will be plastered all over the cars. The way
this will be paid for is by the companies themselves, as these companies are always
charging big fees ontop of the price of the food, tip, and tax there is always money
coming in for the companies per order. Plus with the start of this setup it will only be
cranked out in the larger cities to see if it still makes the companies profitable or not.",,,,,,,,While you are coming up with multiple uses you need to come up with multiple customer groups.

MB,1,Fall,Observation,16," Today my friend and I were talking about different things we could do to hang out and they 
suggested going on a bike ride through the nearby park. I thought it was an awesome idea; however, I 
donât have a bike with me at college and bringing one from home would be too much of a hassle. I 
thought of creating a bike rental service that works with colleges to set it up right on campus to make it 
convenient for college students. This bike rental service doesnât have to cater to students but can also 
encourage campus faculty to also ride bikes instead of driving their car around campus so that they can 
help cut carbon emissions. I would need more people to help start this business and I would need 
connections with various universities and companies that could give me a discount on mass produced 
bikes. The initial cost of the bikes and a business location would be the greatest concern moneywise, but 
after that the thing I would have to worry about most is any bike repairs. I think this business idea 
wouldnât necessarily be the most successful, but I think with the right connections and marketing, it 
could be successful.",,,,,,,,Good job considering if you could make the idea happen!,,,

Since this clothing brand focuses on one issue, it would likely reach out to the one big general market of 
women, which I think is a large enough market already. People I would need to assist me with this 
business would include fashion designers to help make the clothes nice and good quality and

MD,1,Fall,Observation,16,"I realized today that I have been overlooking the obvious when it comes to a business that I could potentially start myself based on my experiences. I have been editing videos for ten years now, and I often get questions about how I am able to work so quickly. Speed is an incredibly important part of working as an editor, and itâs also a really unnatural feeling at first because itâs so easy to get sucked into the âediting black holeâ where you realize that five hours have gone by in the blink of an eye. Slow editing is a problem because in a business like this especially, time is money! If you can only take on a few projects at a time, you will miss out on a lot of money and opportunity. My solution is a class to teach editors how to streamline their work so that it takes as little time as possible to deliver quality work. This can be a business that I can bring directly to consumers, or to a production company to help their employees. The value that they are paying for is the ability to make their work more efficient so that they can complete more projects. I would make money by speaking to editors about how I edit and helping them organize their storyboards so that they can stay efficient!
",,,,,,,,Great job focusing on things that matter to you! You could use a platfrom like Coursera or Udemy to sell your course or make your own set of video editing classes with Teachable.

MD,1,Fall,Observation,16,"Another business opportunity that I thought of today deals with the issue of those with food sensitivities not knowing what meals to make.

Iâve enjoyed cooking for years but now it has become more of a chore because there are so many ingredients I have to avoid. My solution to this is essentially an extension of a business like HelloFresh or Blue Apron, tailored towards those with specific intolerances. The business would be a subscription service that sends you meals plus instructions on how to prepare them, specifically catered to your dietary needs. For example, if you eat gluten free, you would receive meals that donât include gluten, but are still very healthy and delicious. This would help consumers take the stress of preparing food for their condition out of their daily life, and could even be helpful to hospitals or care facilities that donât have the resources to accommodate some of the more intense and restrictive dietary needs.

This was really memorable for me as a kid, and I know that it made them really happy too. This is why I thought that a personalized letter from Santa business could be really successful! Parents are doing more and more every year to help their child feel special on Christmas, and an Etsy shop that creates beautiful, personalized notes from Santa, talking about the cookies that they left for him, and how he thinks that they were very well behaved this year, would be a great addition to the day. This could be something that parents purchase for their children or something that a childrenâs hospital for example, purchases in bulk for the kids staying in the hospital on Christmas. It could be something that is repurchased every year, and it would have great margins because the only thing that I would be producing is a note with nice paper, a good quality pen and some glitter / ribbon.

JH,1,Fall,Observation,16," Bigger bike seat for all â Today, I heard my boyfriend complain that his bike seat was too small and 
uncomfortable for him, and it made biking uphill especially challenging and uncomfortable on his 
campus. He even showed me it on videocall and while it looked like a regular sized bike seat to me, I 
realized to may be uncomfortable for other people especially people on an uphill campus. It made me 
wonder why there wasnât some sort of accommodating bigger/more comfortable bike seat for those 
who wish for a more comfortable ride who arenât doing competitive mountain biking or other sorts. 
After looking at pictures of the typical bike seat, my solution is to make the seat a little bit bigger and 
specifically make the seat material and cushion suited for those who want to pursue a gentler and more 
comfortable ride. This is also my criteria for the seat so it can apply not only to my boyfriend but groups 
like the elderly or those who suffer from autoimmune disorders like arthritis who need to be more 
comfortable on rides. The elderly specifically have wearier bones, and usually are in the market for a 
slow bike ride to the bakery or to town square so thatâs why my product may appeal to them. Adults 
with autoimmune disorders like arthritis whose joints are generally having a hard time to begin with 
probably would desire as comfortable as a ride as possible since biking itself may usually be a struggle. 
As for payment wise, this will be a one-time purchase as most people will just need 1 to 2 bikes for their 
entire life as it is not a monthly or even yearly purchase for those who donât pursue extreme sports like 
mountain biking. I think for the comfortable experience of a more comfortable seat people may be 
willing to pay slightly more than a typical bike, probably within a range of 200$ to 280$",,,,,,,,Well done! Just need to assess if it is a good idea for you personally-could you excute the idea or who do oyou know that you could recruit?,,,
JH,1,Fall,Observation,16,"Nearly unbreakable athletic shoes â For the past year years, I feel like Iâve been buying a new pair of 
tennis shoes every year since they always seem to break or degrade in some way before the yearly mark.
Typically, this is fine for people, but for people like me who do not enjoy spending money on myself for 
the most part, spending a minimum of 80 dollars a year on high quality, new athletic shoes every year 
seems like overkill. It made me wonder if we could just make athletic shoes that were specifically 
marketed to last a long time even through heavy use. So, I decided to make my solution, a highly 
reinforced pair of shoes that will last multiple years even with the heavy use people will typically put on 
a pair of tennis shoes. This would appeal heavily to sports athletes who will get a lot more usage out of 
these shoes versus other athletic shoes that would break easily. This would also appeal to my audience, 
regular people who exercise moderately, but heavily enjoy the idea of not having to rebuy regular tennis 
shoes every year if they break. The strong reinforcement and material in these shoes that would prevent 
them from breaking easily would be the main selling point to both groups. Since they are specifically 
marketed for long-time use, it would be reasonable to charge slightly more than a regular pair of tennis 
shoes because it would outlast them in a heartbeat especially since this will be a new purchase every 2 
or 3 years at the minimum. Iâd say a reasonable range would be anywhere from 150 to 250 depending on
the style of shoe would be a doable price range for the main audiences.",,,,,,,,Well done! Just need to assess if it is a good idea for you personally-could you excute the idea or who do oyou know that you could recruit?,,,

be a dangerous situation for us or other people if they forgot to charge their phone and a genuine 
emergency happened. I started thinking about some sort of technology that would be able to sense 
when youâre nearby, such as placed in a bedroom or common room, and would be able to just charge 
your phone remotely without you having to remember to plug it in. I feel like there could also be some 
sort of time limit on it, so it starts charging specifically at night and not every second youâre nearby to 
conserve energy if you stay at the house all day. This would appeal greatly to forgetful people such as my
boyfriend who would enjoy the convenience of not having to remember to plug it in at all as well as tech 
savvy individuals who would enjoy the Bluetooth technology at work. I feel like since this is a solution 
that will make peopleâs lives easier, it could afford a slightly higher price tag than a regular phone 
charger, especially since people typically have a singular phone charger for over a year at a time. Iâd say 
an appropriate range would be somewhere from 35$ to 50$ would be a price people would go for

CR,0,Fall,Observation,16,"Sweat reppelent for hats

Problem - As someone who tends to where hats often and someone who played baseball I often times had to deal with sweat stains and gross coloration on my hats. Something that ive always been super intrgued by is a hat or a system or product that doesnt allow for the hats to show the sweat or repells the sweat from entering the hats surface. Usually when discolorization happens it makes the hat stink and it also makes it so it gets stiff and shrinks on you. The hats dont last as long and they can stink if it gets really bad.

Solution - I started researching if there was any hat brands or any products that you can use that eliminates sweat. I found a few companies tha claim to have sweat proof hats and none of them had good reviews. As i kept researching I found the hat brand Melin that guarenteed the hat would be sweat proof. This brand specifically had good reviews and seemed like a quality product ( it was a 70$ hat ) I had it for two weeks and already was seeing sweat stains. With the technology we have today we are more than capapble to create some sort of spray to spray on the inside of the hat to act almost as if it was primer holding in water from going into wood. This could be a thin inner layer that repells/obsorbs the sweat. You would need to spray it in multiple times but you could also make it anti bicrobial which allows it to be odor free as well. We already do have a spray in that caliber it would just need to be in a way it wouldnt effect someones hair. A product like this could easily be something retail stores and potentially other hat companies would jump on and try and bring into there business. There would also be a very good chance you could try and partner with Major league baseball where they can be an ambassador for the product. I think the market for something like this is there and if you could team up with the right people I think you could easily be a succesful wholesale and retail business.",,,,,,,,Nice! Good work exploring and figuring out what it would take to make it happen. It's also okay to identify areas of risk like the chemical release of hats into people's eyes when they sweat or the HIPPA and Privacy issues of employer sponsored mental health assessments-some might worry they'd be discriminated against for promotions. ,,,

Problem - I think we could all agree that we could be more orginized. I personally deal with this issues everyday, I wish there was a way for me to orginize everything in my phone, computer or even just orginize plans. 

Solution - We have other AI generated softwares where they provide a serive to orginize certain things in our lives. RocketMoney comes to my mind when researching this product its main goal is to help people save money on subscriptions they shouldnt be paying for. This product has the same goal but instead of trying to save you money its goal is to save you time. The only thing more valuable than money is our time. It would be really cool in my opinion To develop something to allow us to save our time and keep us orginized, Delete duplicates of things are phone, Allow AI to see how much time we spend on certain apps and areas in our phone and delete the ones we dont really use and put the important ones into a place where we can get them easily. I believe selling an APP of some sorts where its a one time purchase or you allow a free version with adds. With all of my ideas I do believe there is a market for this product and if done properly and marketed properly you could easily develop revenue from people who want to be more orginized and not have to spend the time doing it for themselves.",,,,,,,,Nice!

I thought of this idea of an insulated sauna suit that emits moisture inside of it. Most ""sauna"" suits are just plastic but require a sweat to start getting hot. I think you could get a chargeable neoprene suit that is connected to a hose of some sort to create moisture and steam inside the suit. It would be a legit sauna suit. You could get a good sweat by just doing jumping jacks and stationary workouts.  Groups and Segments: Technically it's illegal for wrestlers to wear sauna suits but I think it would draw them to it.

be able to sort the waste that comes in therefore eliminating the cross-contamination
between different materials. Groups of people that would be the most interested in this
product would be big businesses like universities and corporations that have big offices
where they can place a few of the smart recycling bins around their campuses.
Universities and bigger corporations will be willing to pay for the smart recycling bin due
to the fact that these are sectors that are always trying to stay up to date with the newest
technology and can afford to. Along with that if the smart recycling bin gets the
p[opularity from the students or the employees that can kind of push the bigger
companies and universities into buying multiple to put across campus. This product is a

be neglected. Along with all of the risks if the wrong person is taking care of a family
member, the person has to make a living off of that care which means its expensive
when adding up if the client is 24 hour care, any millage reimbursements, the employees
pay, medications, etc. Well to eliminate all of those issues, why not have a roboto take
care of the family member that needs the help. A robot will not be able to harass or

Order of what I believed to be good business opportunities: #3, #1, and #2
Opportunity #1: Is creating a public transportation electric bussing system a good business 
opportunity?
ChatGPT: Creating a public transportation electric bussing system can indeed be a promising 
business opportunity, especially in light of the growing emphasis on sustainable and eco-friendly 
transportation solutions. Here are some reasons why this could be a favorable venture:
â¢ Environmental concerns: The increasing global focus on reducing carbon emissions and 
combating climate change has led to a significant push for sustainable transportation 
solutions. Electric buses are seen as a key component of a greener public transportation 
system.
â¢ Government initiatives and incentives: Many governments are offering incentives, 
subsidies, and grants to companies that are investing in and operating electric public 
transportation systems as part of their efforts to promote sustainable infrastructure and 
reduce air pollution.
â¢ Cost savings in the long run: While the initial investment in electric buses may be higher 
compared to traditional buses, the long-term operational costs can be significantly lower. 
Electric buses generally have lower maintenance costs and are less reliant on volatile 
fossil fuel prices, making them a cost-effective option over time.
â¢ 
Public demand for sustainable transportation: As environmental awareness grows, there 
is an increasing demand from the public for sustainable transportation options. By 
providing electric bussing systems, you can cater to this demand and potentially attract 
more passengers, thereby establishing a competitive advantage.
â¢ Brand positioning and corporate social responsibility: Operating an electric bussing 
system can enhance your company's brand image, demonstrating your commitment to 
sustainability and environmental responsibility. This can attract environmentally 
conscious consumers and stakeholders, contributing to a positive brand reputation.
However, it's essential to consider some challenges as well, such as the initial infrastructure 
setup costs, battery charging infrastructure requirements, and potential regulatory hurdles. 
Conduct thorough market research and feasibility studies to understand the local demand, 
regulatory landscape, and potential challenges before pursuing this business opportunity. 
Additionally, consider forming partnerships with local governments or transportation authorities 
to ensure a smooth implementation process and to benefit from potential funding opportunities 
and regulatory support.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights, especially on whether this is a good 
investment. The initial costs of the technology would be larger, however, in the long run, the 
expenses may end up being lessâespecially if certain local governments offer grants to help 
start the business. Although I find businesses that focus on sustainability to be intriguing, I donât 
think Iâll consider this as an EVP contender because there are other business ventures out there 
that I would rather pursue.

Opportunity #2: Is creating a business that specializes in helping host virtual events a good 
business opportunity?
ChatGPT: Yes, creating a business that specializes in helping host virtual events can be a 
lucrative business opportunity, especially considering the rise of remote work and the increased 
demand for virtual gatherings. Here are some reasons why this venture could be promising:
â¢ 
Increased demand for virtual events: With the global shift towards remote work and 
virtual interactions, the demand for well-organized and engaging virtual events, such as 
conferences, webinars, and virtual trade shows, has significantly increased. Businesses 
and organizations are looking for professional event management services to ensure the 
success of their virtual gatherings.
â¢ Technological advancements: The continuous development of sophisticated virtual event 
platforms, collaboration tools, and interactive features has enabled the creation of more 
immersive and engaging virtual event experiences. Your business can leverage these 
technological advancements to provide seamless event management services and enhance 
the overall attendee experience.
â¢ Global accessibility and inclusivity: Virtual events allow for greater accessibility and 
inclusivity, as participants can join from anywhere in the world without the constraints of 
travel or geographical limitations. By facilitating inclusive virtual events, your business 
can cater to a broader audience and offer a more diverse and engaging experience for 
participants.
â¢ Cost-effective alternatives: Hosting virtual events often incurs lower costs compared to 
traditional in-person events, as it eliminates expenses related to venue rentals, catering, 
and travel. Your business can position itself as a cost-effective solution for businesses 
and organizations looking to host high-quality events without the financial burden 
associated with physical gatherings.
â¢ Customized event management services: By offering tailored event management services, 
including virtual event planning, technical support, and attendee engagement strategies, 
your business can cater to the specific needs and preferences of clients, ensuring that each 
event is meticulously planned and executed to achieve the desired objectives.
To ensure the success of your business, it is essential to stay updated with the latest virtual event 
technologies, prioritize user-friendly interfaces, and provide comprehensive customer support 
throughout the event planning and execution process. Additionally, focus on building strong 
partnerships with industry experts, technology providers, and event planners to establish a 
reputable and reliable brand in the virtual events management sector.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights on how this could turn out to be an 
excellent business venture. It suggested that I need to make sure to stay updated with the latest 
virtual technologies and should build strong partnerships with experts in the industry. I agree 
with these suggestions, and I think that this could be a good business venture because itâs 
cheaper than other ventures; however, Iâm not sure if I personally would pursue it for my EVP 
project because itâs not really under my expertise.

Opportunity #3: Would creating a mental health app that tailors specifically to each person and 
their needs be a good business venture?
ChatGPT: Creating a personalized mental health app that tailors specifically to each individual's 
needs can indeed be a meaningful and potentially successful business venture. Here's why this 
can be a good opportunity:
â¢ 
Increasing awareness and demand for mental health support: The growing awareness and 
acceptance of mental health issues have led to an increased demand for accessible and 
personalized mental health services. A tailored app that addresses individual needs can 
cater to this demand and provide users with a sense of control over their mental well-
being.
â¢ Customized support and resources: Offering personalized support, therapy, and resources 
based on users' specific mental health concerns and goals can significantly improve 
engagement and outcomes. By providing tailored content and tools, your app can enhance 
user experiences and encourage regular usage, leading to better mental health 
management.
â¢ Remote accessibility and convenience: A mobile mental health app can provide users 
with convenient access to support and resources from anywhere at any time. This 
accessibility can be particularly beneficial for individuals who may have limited access to 
in-person mental health services or prefer the privacy and convenience of remote support.
â¢ Data-driven insights and progress tracking: By integrating data analytics and progress 
tracking features, your app can offer users valuable insights into their mental health 
journey, helping them monitor their progress and make informed decisions regarding
their well-being. Personalized data insights can also contribute to the development of 
tailored interventions and support strategies.
â¢ Collaboration with mental health professionals: Partnering with licensed mental health 
professionals, therapists, and counselors can add credibility and expertise to your app's 
offerings. Providing users with the option for virtual consultations or therapy sessions can 
further enhance the effectiveness and trustworthiness of your mental health app.
â¢ 
Potential for scalability and impact: Given the global prevalence of mental health issues, 
developing a scalable and user-friendly mental health app has the potential to reach a 
broad audience and make a significant positive impact on the well-being of users 
worldwide.
To ensure the success of your business venture, prioritize user data privacy and security, 
maintain compliance with relevant healthcare regulations, and focus on building a supportive and 
engaging user community. Collaborate with mental health professionals, researchers, and 
technology experts to continuously improve and evolve your app's features and offerings based 
on the latest advancements in mental health research and technology.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights on this opportunity including pairing with 
mental health professionals and privacy settings. I think this would be a great business venture 

and I may consider pursuing this one because it requires less costs to start it and is a topic that is 
important to me.",,,,,,,,Good work!,,,

with food delivery platforms to encourage their adoption of sustainable packaging.
Opportunity 2: Remote Work and Wellness Platform
Problem: The rise of remote work has brought challenges related to employee well-being, 
isolation, and work-life balance.
Solution: Create an online platform that offers a suite of tools and resources to support remote 
workers' mental and physical health. This platform can include virtual fitness classes, mental 
health resources, community-building features, and productivity tools tailored for remote work.
Potential Market: The potential market for a remote work and wellness platform includes remote 
workers, freelancers, remote-first companies, and organizations looking to support their remote 
workforce.
Revenue Model: Generate revenue through subscription-based plans for individual users and 
corporate clients. Offer a free basic version with premium features for paid subscribers. 
Additionally, collaborate with companies to provide employee well-being packages and establish
affiliate partnerships with fitness instructors and mental health professionals.
Opportunity 3: Electric Urban Mobility Service
Problem: Increasing urbanization and environmental concerns are driving the need for 
sustainable urban transportation options in densely populated areas.
Solution: Launch an electric urban mobility service that offers electric scooters, bikes, and small 
electric cars for short-term rentals. These vehicles will be available for rent via a smartphone app
and strategically located in urban areas.
Potential Market: The potential market for electric urban mobility services includes urban 
commuters, tourists, students, and city dwellers who want eco-friendly transportation 
alternatives.
Revenue Model: Generate revenue through pay-as-you-go rental fees or subscription-based plans
for frequent users. Implement advertising opportunities on the vehicles and in the app. Partner 
with local businesses to offer discounts to users, and explore government incentives for electric 
mobility programs to reduce costs and increase user adoption.
These opportunities address pressing issues in today's world and offer innovative solutions with 
the potential to reach broad markets and generate revenue through diverse models. Each 
opportunity combines business and sustainability, reflecting the evolving needs of consumers 
and the environment.
From this generation, all of these ideas are great ideas. With ranking them, my number 
one choice would have to be sustainable food packaging. This was really brought to my attention
because I actually just saw a social media post about how pollution has risen more than 100% in 
the past 20 years more than 100%. Creating this would decrease that to help the environment. 
Personally, I think the world needs to change in this aspect of learning about this today because 
that is just absolutely awful. This would also be great for food chains to get on because so much 
waste is created from individuals purchasing food every single day. The second one for my 
ranking would have to be Electric Urban Mobility Services. This would be great for certain states
with a huge population such as New York, California, Florida, etc. The last one of these 
opportunities is remote work. This is already very common to people, especially after the 
CoronaVirus happened. I donât think any of these options would be good for the EVP assignment
for me personally because I want to be extremely passionate about the topic I pursue for the 
assignment.",,,,,,,,Nice assessment of good opportunity for someone with... and not good for me personally.,,,

penetration and competitiveness may present difficulties. As such, it receives the lowest ranking 
out of the three opportunities.",,,,,,,,Well done.,,,
MD,1,Fall,AI,17,"âCan you come up with three separate business models that include potential market and revenue models?â

 Outcome One: On-Demand Home Cleaning Service (Best Idea)

The business model that the AI came up with first is an on-demand home cleaning service. The market that was suggested was urban and suburban homeowners and renters, in addition to corporate offices. The revenue models included were either a service fee based on the size of the home and services requested, or a subscription plan where regular services were provided every month or so for a slightly discounted rate. I believe this to be the best of the three outcomes, because I can definitely see the need for it, especially with something like corporate offices that need their spaces cleaned very regularly. I can see this as a good elevator pitch idea if I hadnât already chosen mine. 

 Outcome Two: Eco-Friendly Home Improvement Store

The second business model that the AI suggested was an eco-friendly home improvement store. The suggested market for this type of business is environmentally conscious homeowners as well as architects and designers. The revenue model would be product sales and installation services, as well as perhaps consulting services. I really enjoy this idea, especially because we have a store similar to this in my hometown. However, it is quite niche, and I can see it being difficult to maintain in a more rural area. Home improvement products are already expensive, and the truth is that most people in a small town probably wonât want to spend even more money just to make it more eco-friendly. For this reason, I wouldnât consider making this my elevator pitch. 

Outcome Three: Mobile App For Personalized Fitness Training (Worst Idea)

The third and final business model that the AI suggested was a mobile app for personalized fitness training. The suggested market for the business are fitness enthusiasts as well as senior citizens looking to exercise more. The revenue model would include in-app purchases and subscription fees. This is my least favorite idea by far. In my opinion, the fitness app business itself seems to be going downhill quickly because of the fact that there are so many amazing and free resources on Youtube, Instagram, TikTok, and more. I get that there could be a potential âpersonalizationâ aspect to the workouts on an app, but the same is true for Youtube. You can look up âWorkouts for momsâ, âWorkouts for people with thyroid issuesâ, âWorkouts for people with asthmaâ and you will get results. The other issue that I have with this output is suggesting that a senior citizenâs first instinct would be to go to an app for fitness training, and I just canât think of one senior citizen in my life that would enjoy that. For these reasons, I would not consider this idea for my elevator pitch.

MG,1,Fall,AI,17,"Question: Problems with athletes 

problem 1: Injuries: Sports-related injuries are prevalent and can have a significant impact on an athlete's career. These injuries can range from minor sprains and strains to more severe conditions like torn ligaments or fractures. These are something that can't really be avoided but something that can be a semi solution is just doing preventative stuff and learning your body so you know when something is remotely wrong, and take precation actions. People who would be interested in this is all athletes along with coaches to prevent injury and having to sit out because of it.

problem 2: Overtraining: Pushing the body too hard without adequate rest and recovery can lead to overtraining, causing fatigue, decreased performance, and an increased risk of injury. This is also a very common thing and that is why the NCAA requires that in season athletes get at least one day off per week. A solution for this is giving athletes two mental health days per semester to be able to take when they need. This will allow them to take a day to regroup if your body needs it or if you need it mentally. This is helpful to athletes and the coaches it will allow athletes to be able to take a day and be able to be better in the future.

problem 3: Performance Slumps: Athletes can go through periods of poor performance or a ""slump,"" which can be frustrating and affect their confidence. Everyone goes through this at one point or another, and the only solution to this problem is being able to get your confidence back from your teammates and being able to rely on them a little but more ask for help and they will build you up. This is helpful to know how to do this for athletes but also anyone in relationships. People go through all sorts of different things and you need to learn to ask for help and rely on others a little bit at times.

 
",,,,,,,,Good job but this was the Chat GPT assignment. If you read this feedback before you do Fridays just turn in the GPT version then. Good luck against Ohio!,,,
JH,1,Fall,AI,17,"
ChatGPT input: 3 business ideas to solve daily problems with solutions, market audience, and 
revenue models
ChatGPT output:
1. 
Pet Waste Cleanup and Disposal Service:
Problem: Many pet owners struggle with the hassle of cleaning up after their pets, especially in shared 
community spaces.
Solution: Start a pet waste cleanup service that offers scheduled or on-demand waste removal. You 
could use eco-friendly methods to collect and dispose of pet waste, leaving public spaces clean and 
odor-free.
Target Market: Pet owners, property management companies, and local municipalities.
Revenue Model: Charge a subscription fee for regular service to pet owners and establish contracts with 
property management companies or local governments for public area cleanups. You can also offer one-
time cleanup services for non-subscribers.
2. 
Home Maintenance Subscription Service:
Problem: Homeowners often neglect regular maintenance tasks, leading to costly repairs down the line.
Solution: Create a subscription-based home maintenance service that provides regular inspections, 
maintenance, and minor repairs. Offer various tiers of subscription plans to suit different needs and 
budgets.
Target Market: Homeowners, real estate investors, and property management companies.
Revenue Model: Charge a monthly or annual subscription fee based on the level of service required. 
Additional revenue can come from upselling repair services for more significant issues discovered during 
inspections.
3. 
Personalized Health and Fitness Coaching App:
Problem: Many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including exercise and nutrition, due to a 
lack of guidance and motivation.
Solution: Develop a mobile app that offers personalized health and fitness coaching. Users can receive 
tailored exercise routines, meal plans, and daily motivation from certified coaches.
Target Market: Health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and people looking for lifestyle changes.
Revenue Model: Offer a free version of the app with limited features to attract users and charge a 
subscription fee for premium access with personalized coaching and advanced features. Additionally, you
can generate revenue through in-app advertisements or partnerships with fitness equipment and 
nutrition companies.
As for my evaluation, I believe all of them sound like genuinely pursuable business ventures that have 
been tried, tested, and successful for entrepreneurs in the past. I think the home maintenance 
subscription service is the business venture Iâm least likely to pursue as my knowledge for home 
maintenance is limited at best and none more realistically. The pet waste disposal business idea sounds 
okay, but a little bit messy for my taste although I do admit it is a good idea to pursue so thatâs more of 
my middle choice. So, by process of elimination, I would most likely pursue the personalized health and 
fitness coaching app because I do have a strong interest and passion for fitness as well as an interest in 
coaching and working with others to pursue and achieve their goals. This is something I have genuinely 
considered pursuing someday in the past, so I could easily still see that being a reality today. I believe 
this could also be an idea I wouldnât be against pursuing for the EVP assignment. I think I would prefer to 
come up with my own idea though of something I am more modernly passionate about and something I 
think up organically instead of using a ChatGPT prompt, but definitely something Iâm open to revisiting if 
it piques my interest between now and then.",,,,,,,,Bravo! Nice work with the feasible for you assessment.,,,

CR,0,Fall,AI,17,"What I typed in - 3 new business proposals with market assesments 

1.Customized Wellness and Mental Health Apps

Market Evaluation: The global wellness and mental health app market has been experiencing significant growth, especially due to the increased awareness of mental health issues and the need for self-care. Customized apps that offer personalized mental health resources, meditation guides, fitness routines, and nutrition plans can cater to this growing demand. With the right marketing and user experience, such apps can attract a large user base. Monetization strategies can include subscription models, in-app purchases, or partnerships with healthcare providers and employers.

Chatgpt loves anything to do with wellness. I like this idea however it seems like this sort of thing is already in existance and wouldnt bring anything particularly new to the world, It would have to be done right and offer something other wellness apps dont. Chatgpt is correct the health and wellness app market is a growing market and it makes it easy and accessable to anyone who wants to grow themselves. I think this could be a pretty solid idea and while im not a big "" make an app "" guy for it, it does offer some needs that could easily be met if done and marketed properly.

2.Eco-Friendly Subscription Box Service

Market Evaluation: The eco-friendly and sustainable products market is expanding as consumers become more environmentally conscious. A subscription box service that delivers curated eco-friendly products, such as reusable items, organic skincare, and sustainable home goods, can appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The subscription model provides a predictable revenue stream, and partnerships with eco-conscious brands can enhance the product offerings. The market evaluation for this business idea is positive, given the increasing global focus on sustainability and eco-friendly living.

This is a neat idea, I dont hate it and I think it could be inticing to certain people. The only thing that would worry me about this is how would it be done? Would you partner with other sustainable companies and use those in your boxes? Or do you create your own product as a whole. It could be somewhat costly as the ECO-Friendly world tends to be pretty pricey it ultimatley comes down to how you market it and how you sell it. I think the best way would be a subscription but it would be cool to gift people these things or be able to customize them to your prefernce. It would be really cool to pick and chose what u get. The market seems to be there and there is a need for this and i think it could be succesful if marketed well.

3. Virtual Events and Experiences Platform

Market Evaluation: The events industry has undergone a transformation, with a significant shift toward virtual and hybrid events. A platform that specializes in hosting virtual conferences, trade shows, concerts, workshops, and unique virtual experiences has a substantial market potential. With the ongoing advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the demand for immersive virtual events is on the rise. Businesses, organizations, and individuals are willing to pay for high-quality virtual event platforms that offer engaging and interactive experiences. The market evaluation for virtual events platforms is promising, especially considering the flexibility and convenience they provide to participants and organizers alike.

Here goes chatgpt with another VR business proposition. I havent seen anything out there that exists like this and I think there is a reason for that. This is not a good idea, Events are meant to be in purpose and I dont think virtual events would gain any attraction. In fact my dad works in the event business and I teand to work for him often and in order to truly immerse yourself and get a full on expirience you have to be there in person. I dont think anyone in there right mind would jump at this even if the events industry has undergone transformation. It isnt going to be something that people want.

GS,1,Fall,AI,17,"Subscription that develops film for photographers:

One problem or annoyance that I run into a lot as a film photographer is the high prices of developing film photos. Places that I have looked and used it ranges from $15-85+ per roll of film. Of course that is dependent on what kind of film you are using. An idea I had was to have a subscription based film developer. Most photographers mail their film in somewhere because unless you are in California (there is a lot of film labs there) really youâre only option is Walmart to develop film at and Walmart labs are horrible and donât develop the full roll. There are so many great labs out there and it would be a great idea to have a flat rate each month that photographers pay and you can send In up to ____ rolls. Some photographers I know use 8-10 per wedding day so it would be great to get some sort of discount or savings by having a subscription. I donât think this would take a lot of extreme marketing. More just having it as an option for photographers because I know myself and a lot of others would do it.
ChatGPT suggested âSubscription Plans: Review the pricing and terms of their subscription plans, including the frequency of film shipments and any discounts for long-term commitments.â I think that is a great idea. Example: If you purchase X amount of months, you receive ___ off.

This is an idea that I have been thinking about doing within my business. ChatGPT suggested writing a short note on each polaroid before giving it to the couple. I love that idea but find it a little unrealistic. The only time as a wedding photographer youâd be able to is during dinner and that is your time to decompress before getting right back to work. ChatGPT also suggested getting an album to give them in at the end of the night. Iâm a big fan of that idea. Overall, it wouldnât be an additional fee that clients would âseeâ or take notice of in the packages but it would be something that I could charge for or increase the prices to cover those costs.

What are things I could charge extra for as a wedding photographer

ChatGPT gave a long list to this question. With 19 bullet points, one that ChatGPT gave is Post-Wedding Sessions: Offer ""Trash the Dress"" or ""Day-After"" sessions where the couple gets to wear their wedding attire again, often in unique locations or different conditions. I think a day after session is a great thing to offer as an add on. You can market it as your first photos as husband and wife and a more relaxed shoot after a hustling day. Another thing ChatGPT suggested was Print Release: Charge for providing a print release that allows the couple to print photos on their own without restrictions. I donât like that idea. My clients and clients that find me tend to like that I include printing rights with my packages. With that, I get to charge a little extra and they donât have to go through the hassle of needing an extra paper that says they can print or have to factor in extra costs.",,,,,,,,Doing great! Just need some pricing/time required estimate. The album makes me think of wedding line displays where they have pictures of the bride and groom as kids at various stages. Perhaps you already offer this but you could compile an album ahead of the big day that is like that as kind of the journey up to that point including engagement pictures and then slip the polaroid in the back of that. Definitely take some planning but plenty of third parties you could outsource production to if gathering the photos wasn't too challenging.,,,

Prompt 1: What are 3 problems with solutions that require a new product invention?
Prompt 2: What is the potential markets and revenue solutions for all of the solutions?
Problem: Water Scarcity
Solution: Solar-Powered Atmospheric Water Generator
â Many regions around the world suffer from water scarcity. A new product invention could
be a solar-powered atmospheric water generator that extracts moisture from the air and
converts it into clean, drinkable water. This innovation could help address water
shortages, especially in arid areas where traditional water sources are limited.
Market:
â 
This invention can target a global market, with a particular focus on regions suffering
from water scarcity, including arid and remote areas. It can also have applications in
disaster relief and military operations where access to clean water is crucial.
Revenue Solutions:
â 
Selling the atmospheric water generators directly to consumers, businesses, and
governments.
â Offering subscription-based services for maintenance and filter replacements.
â 
Licensing the technology to manufacturers for wider production and distribution.
â 
Partnering with humanitarian organizations for deployment in emergency situations.
Analysis:
â 
I thought this problem and solution was a decent idea with how the water quality has
been in the past year this potential product would of made a some money during the
Ohio train derailment affecting the local water supply and another section of the United
States where this company would always be constantly making a good revenue is the
west coast where they always have yearly fires that destroy the air quality which further
along affects the water quality.
Problem: Food Waste
Solution: Smart Food Preservation System
â 
Food waste is a significant global issue. A new product invention could be a smart food
preservation system that uses advanced sensors, humidity control, and expiration date
tracking to extend the shelf life of perishable foods. Such a system could help reduce
food waste and save consumers money while promoting sustainability.
Market:
â 
The market for smart food preservation systems includes households, restaurants,
grocery stores, and the food industry. It can also be marketed to countries and regions
with high levels of food waste.
Revenue Solutions:
â 
Selling the preservation systems to consumers, restaurants, and businesses.
â Offering a subscription-based model for ongoing food freshness monitoring and system
maintenance.
â 
Licensing the technology to food packaging and appliance manufacturers.
â 
Partnering with food retailers to use the technology for reducing food waste.
Analysis:

â 
I thought this would be a good idea I did notice with the food preservation that ChatGPT
didnât include âDoomsdayâ organizations even though it is a niche market or group. This
would be a good invention for them as well as hikers and rock climbers who pack their
food for months on end to be able to eat while they hike and rock clim away from home.
Problem: Air Pollution and Allergens
Solution: Wearable Air Quality Monitor with Air Purification
â Air pollution and allergens can have detrimental effects on health. A new product
invention could be a wearable device that not only monitors air quality in real-time but
also has a built-in air purification system. This device would allow individuals to protect
themselves from pollutants and allergens, especially in urban environments with poor air
quality.
Market:
â 
This invention can target urban populations in areas with poor air quality, as well as
individuals with respiratory conditions, allergies, and those who are health-conscious.
Revenue Solutions:
â 
Selling the wearable devices to consumers through online and retail channels.
â Offering a subscription model for air quality data services and filter replacements.
â 
Partnering with healthcare providers and insurance companies to promote the use of
these devices among individuals with health concerns.
â 
Licensing the technology to clothing and wearable tech manufacturers to integrate into
their product lines.
Analysis:
â 
I thought this problem and solution was a very good idea with how the air quality has
been in the past year this potential company would of made a plethora of money during
the Canada fires and another section of the United States where this company would
always be constantly making a good revenue is the west coast where they always have
yearly fires that destroy the air quality. The only thing I would add to the revenue
solutions is including schools and hospitals in the first bullet point as this would most
likely be the first organizations to be quick to buy one of the products. I feel like this
product would be good for people whop have asthma or other breathing conditions
however I do not see this becoming a very popular thing until later in the future when the
air quality has really gone down hill.
Rankings:
1. The Wearable Air Quality Monitor With Air Purification
2. The Water Generator
3. The Smart Food Preservation System
I ranked this from the greatest potential to the least potential for the general public. I see a lot
about the air quality and water quality but nothing about food preservation. For food I have seen
plans on how to create less food waste but not on how to preserve food other than the known
ways like freeze drying and dehydrating. I do feel like if one had to be pursued I would choose
the wearable air quality monitor as there would be evidence on how air quality effects the whole
population making it easier to âsellâ using ethos with the potential customers.",,,,,,,,Daily practice-submitted too early,,,

I work at my waitress job about three or four days a week in downtown Mount Pleasant named

had the thought of other businesses around Mount Pleasant partnering up with the restaurant to 
bring more attention and sales for the company. Companies that could participate in this could be

I have often been told that Iâm a good gift giver, and I always thought that it would be nice to help others find gifts for holidays and special occasions using the recipientâs interests and hobbies. For example, if someone came to me and told me that their dad loves Harry Potter, fencing and the color blue, I would go find a selection of unique gifts to buy for him! This would be set up as a sort of consultation service that would generate revenue from the customer as well as businesses that I could partner with to include their products when appropriate. I would probably start out by charging thirty dollars for a 10 minute consultation. The market for this could be for individuals looking for ideas of what to buy for someone for a special occasion such as a wedding, anniversary or holiday. It could also be used for corporate and business gift giving in the event that businesses are looking to give a personalized gift to build client or employee relationships. I do think that itâs a bit of a niche market, but I think that there are enough people that donât consider themselves to be good at gift giving that would try out the consulting service for a special occasion.

JH,1,Fall,Observation,18," Communication based app â During the weekend, my long-distance boyfriend was in town, and it was 
very nice to be able to spend time with him. Although our communication is strong after dating for 
almost 5 months, our long distance can make our communication a little bit finnicky virtually and in 
person. It can be frustrating at times because we canât spend that quality time together to improve that 
communication. At best, we get maybe once a month to see each other and lots of other long-distance 
relationships get even less. I started thinking about an educational and interactive communication-based
geared for people looking to find ways to improve their communication, which would be especially 
useful for people who cannot be in person together for an extended period of time. I think the 
interactive part of the app could have fun games and puzzles to work out together as well as widgets for 
communication itself like buttons to send notifications to the other personâs phone such as âI want to 
talkâ or âI miss youâ or âIâm feeling ___â. I think first audience who would be interested in this are long 
distance couples such as myself who wish to still feel close to their partner and feel like they are still 
developing their relationship despite the distance. The second group of interest would be any other 
relationship/friendship (long distance or not) who wishes to learn more about communication and play 
fun games and have access to the widget buttons. I think people would be willing to pay 5 dollars or less 
for this app, maybe if I were to include premium functions like 10 dollars because it does come with 
special features and has the potential to improve relationships, which does mean a lot to people. I could 
also bring in revenue from displaying advertisements on the app itself. This price point, with a good 
amount of traffic, would be able to make a profit despite all the marketing fees and technology work Iâd 
have to put into the app.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

made me think of some sort of calorie tracker device that was able to immediately detect the number of 
calories and nutritional macros of a meal to not cause the person to have hours of tracking and figuring 
out the nutritional value of every meal. I think this would be a useful device for anybody looking to 
seriously build muscle and will need an accurate protein counter to save time. Another group who would
be interested are people trying to lose weight within the fitness community who would also need a 
speedy calorie count. I think people would pay anywhere from 50 to 100 dollars because it would be 
such a time saver in terms of tracking meals. I think thereâs a large rise of people interested in fitness 
who would want a device like this and would be able to pay money for it. I think at least 50 dollars a pop 
per person would be enough to finance creating the product although I think it would be a somewhat

JH,1,Fall,Observation,18,"Mascara for straight lashes â I have tried many mascaras, but they often donât work with my lash type 
because mine are hard to curl since they are straight. Most people have longer lashes that are able to be 
curled easier or better yet not curled at all. But there is a population of people with straight lashes, and 
this often doesnât mesh well with modern mascara types. I think cultivating a new mascara blend that 
works nicely on straight lashes would be revolutionary for the underrepresented group of people who 
may not even be able to wear mascara in the first place because it doesnât work for their lash type. This 
would strongly appeal to people with straight lashes instead of regular lashes who may feel like mascara 
simply doesnât work for them. I feel like this could also appeal to people with naturally short lashes who 
struggle to see results with normal mascaras because of the lack of length. Because it applies to an 
underrepresented group within the makeup community, I would charge somewhere from 10 to 13 
dollars for a tube of this mascara because itâs a solid price for the service it is able to provide for people. I
think it would take time and a good chemist to cultivate the best product for these two groups, so it may

I personally don't think common folks would pay for this, but if someone really enjoys cooking and has the extra money to afford it, I think it would be something that they would be interested in trying out. In order to really make a profit you would have to really push the subscription packages. Perhaps some cooking appliance companies or food network tv services would be interested in developing something like this.

NN,1,Fall,Observation,18,"Storage service-- Having clutter in your home can be annoying. It can also be annoying trying to figure out how to effectively store all that clutter. An interesting business idea could be a professional decluttering service in which someone who is very informed and good at packing things away in containers, boxes, drawers, etc. can come into your home and help you declutter! I personally would not want to pay for this myself but I'm sure there are people out there who hate organizing so much that they would be willing to pay someone to do it for them. Perhaps HGTV could make a TV show out of it or interior design/home magazines could have a article column highlighting the various different decluttering stories in people's homes. Now that I think about it there's a Netflix series called Marie Kondo that actually does this. You could generate revenue by charging a fee depending on the size/scale of the decluttering that needs to happen.

NN,1,Fall,Observation,18,"Home swap-- I have an idea for people who want to travel to different places without spending a ton of money. Why not develop a business that allows people to exchange homes with each other if they live in a place the other wants to visit? That way both of them don't have to spend money while still getting the benefits of traveling. There could be a website where they sign up and undergo background checks and things like that to make sure they won't do anything bad, and there could be a fee to sign up & use the website to generate revenue. It would save people so much money from not having to buy a hotel. Perhaps rental services like AirBnB or Vrbo would be interesting in utilizing an idea like this. I honestly would try it out, but I would definitely want to ensure the other person isn't crazy and would destroy my house, and I also don't really think anybody would want to travel to my apartment in Mt. Pleasant, but maybe one day if I live somewhere cool they would want to do a swap! I actually think there's a Netflix movie that inspired this idea for me called The Holiday.

that took me too long to find. I tried going on the website of the store to see if there 
was any information about where I could find these items. I then thought it would be 
nice if the store had an app that took you on an efficient route in the store to complete 
your list and save time. This would be great for anyone who shops or people getting off

The solution to this is making a podcast that helps you break down you goals into more simple and easy tasks to help trick your mind into thinking that you are a lot more productive than you acually are. People who are depressed or overwhlemed will use this and purchase it on spotify or apple music. It would be a subscription that they would pay for monthly.

JH,1,Fall,Observation,19,"College composting â I was eating with my friend today at lunch when I noticed he was only taking like
one bite of his cupcakes to get all the frosting and leaving the rest of the cupcake out for the trash. He 
did this to 4 cupcakes, and it made me think of how much food waste he was creating and how 
normalized wasting food has become on college campuses. Food waste can be a big problem when it 
comes to environmental concerns and modern climate change problems. Itâs something I care about 
deeply because I consider myself to be sustainably centered in my own life. I think creating some type of 
easy access composting bins around college campuses would help teach college students more about 
being sustainable from an education perspective. This would help food waste issues around college 
campuses and the soil generated from the composting can be sold to different farming vendors. I think 
audiences who would be interested in this would be college campuses looking to enact more 
environmentally friendly initiatives who would allow me to put composting bins on their campus. I think 
another audience would be assorted parks and public facilities with lots of traffic/food consumption who
also may be interested in environmental initiatives and a portion of the profit from selling the compost. 
To make this happen, I may need to self-educate on composting as well as think up a portable compost 
bin that I would be able to set up at outdoor locations. I think customers would be willing to pay at least 
300 a month for this service because they would be able to get a portion of this money back through 
selling of the compost as well as they would be able to look presentable from an environmental 
perspective in the eyes of people passing by because lots of people are sustainably driven nowadays.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
JH,1,Fall,Observation,19," Fresh vegetable/fruit delivery â A lot of people struggle to eat enough fruit and vegetables in a day. I 
feel like I am a part of this group of people as ever since I got sick, I feel like I have not been able to eat 
enough of either on a regular basis. With the rise of food delivery, I started thinking about how useful it 
would be for individuals to have access to a food delivery service dedicated to fruits, vegetables, and 
other wellness products. This could be subscription-based service in conjunction with local farms and 
small businesses in specific regions. I think people would pay around 75 dollars to 125 dollars a month 
for this service to be delivered biweekly with new products of choice because of the convenience of not 
having to go out and find all the vegetables/fruits/wellness products themselves. To put this into 
practice, I would have to communicate with local farms in a specific area until its established before 
expanding outward to different cities. I would also have to be aware this may not work in big cities such 
as New York due to the lack of big farms nearby so it would be more of a medium to slightly bigger city 
concentration as compared to very small or very large cities. 2 audiences that would be interested in this
would be people looking to be healthier in life and people who are looking for the convenience of not 
having to go out and buy a portion of their groceries.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,

him out I ended up agreeing with him. As a college student, Iâm often so busy and having to do dishes

dishwasher for dorm rooms that would allow minimal work when it comes to us having to wash dishes. It
could also be shared amongst roommates which could also be a big pro for some audiences. I think the 
main target markets who would be interested in the product are college kids who want the convenience 
of barely having to clean their own dishes and another target market is adults in apartments with limited
space who might not have access to a dishwasher. I think people would be willing to pay anywhere from 
75 to 100 dollars for a mini dishwasher considering its high convenience and portability. In order to make
this happen, I would have to consult a technology adept individual who would be able to contrast such a 
device as well as do marketing to advertise the product likely through social media as we have a younger 
age range in the target markets who use social media avidly.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
NN,1,Fall,Observation,19,"A lot of people don't like to use harsh chemical cleaning products in their home, because inhaling chemicals can be harmful to health and make you not feel so great. However, you still want to make sure that your home is getting cleaned well. It would be interesting to develop a service that focused on creating all-natural cleaning products that do not produce toxic fumes/chemicals in the area you're cleaning. I am no scientist and I'm not sure if it's entirely possible to create products like this, but I am sure there are enough people out there who care about their body enough to want to purchase products like this. It would probably have to be really expensive in order to generate revenue because I'm sure the all-natural ingredients are not cheap. As far as segmentation, I think that maybe hollistic health/wellness companies, essential oil companies, and brands of that nature would be interested in developing an idea like this.

Imagine if there was an app you could download that you could tailor to the location/city you're in that could give you solid date ideas of what to do for fun. I am aware that Google is similar to this concept, since you could just Google, ""fun date places near me"" but the ""date developer"" app could provide more specific, niche ideas for the location you're in. Perhaps the app could partner with local businesses and each time a couple goes to the business/establishment they discovered through the app, some sort of commission (like 8% return)  could be provided to the app for boosting business in the area. I would be interested in testing an idea like this out. This is a little weird but perhaps dating apps (like Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, Farmersonly.com, Christian Mingle, etc.) would be interested in further developing an idea like this since they would kind of go hand-in-hand.

I'm sure that college or high school students would be interested in possibly utilizing something like this. Or textbook services like Chegg could further develop the idea.

A way to make this website a profitable opportunity for young adults to find verifiable travel partners would be to have a review site similar to the Turo website and had a review on the trip people went with each other.

Order of what I believed to be good business opportunities: #3, #1, and #2
Question #1: Is creating a program that helps teens become young entrepreneurs a good business 
idea?
ChatGPT answer: Creating a program to help teens become young entrepreneurs can be a 
promising and socially impactful business idea. Here are some factors to consider:
â¢ Market Demand:
â¢ Research and analyze the market demand for such programs. Are there existing 
programs? What sets yours apart? Understanding the needs of teenagers interested in 
entrepreneurship is crucial.
â¢ Educational Value:
â¢ Ensure that your program provides substantial educational value. It should cover 
fundamental business skills, such as idea generation, market research, business planning, 
marketing, financial management, and problem-solving.
â¢ Mentorship and Support:
â¢ Consider including mentorship and support elements in your program. Having 
experienced entrepreneurs or business professionals as mentors can greatly enhance the 
learning experience and increase the chances of success for the teens involved.
â¢ 
Interactive Learning:
â¢ Create an interactive and engaging learning environment. This might include workshops, 
group activities, case studies, and real-world projects to reinforce theoretical concepts.
â¢ Adaptability:
â¢ Be adaptable to the evolving needs of the entrepreneurial landscape. Stay updated on 
industry trends and incorporate new technologies and methodologies into your program.
â¢ Networking Opportunities:
â¢ 
Facilitate networking opportunities for the teens. Connecting them with other young 
entrepreneurs, industry professionals, and potential investors can broaden their 
perspectives and open doors for collaboration.
â¢ Partnerships:
â¢ Consider forming partnerships with schools, youth organizations, and businesses to 
increase the reach and impact of your program. Collaborations can also provide 
additional resources and expertise.
â¢ Measurable Outcomes:
â¢ Develop metrics to measure the success of your program. This could include the number 
of successful businesses launched, the revenue generated by participants, and their long-
term entrepreneurial achievements.
â¢ Legal and Ethical Considerations:
â¢ Ensure that your program complies with legal and ethical standards, especially when 
working with minors. This includes obtaining necessary permissions and adhering to 
child protection guidelines.

â¢ Monetization Model:
â¢ Define a sustainable monetization model for your business. This could involve charging 
participants, partnering with educational institutions, or seeking sponsorships and grants.
â¢ Marketing and Outreach:
â¢ Develop a robust marketing strategy to reach your target audience. Use social media, 
online platforms, and partnerships to promote your program.
â¢ Continuous Improvement:
â¢ Commit to continuous improvement based on feedback from participants, mentors, and 
stakeholders. Regularly update your program to address emerging needs and trends.
Remember, the success of your business will depend on the quality of your program, your ability 
to effectively market it, and the impact it has on the lives of the teens involved. If executed well, 
a program that helps teens become young entrepreneurs can be a fulfilling and profitable venture.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good insights for this potential business venture 
including pairing up with schools and other organizations. This would be a good program to 
implement in high schools and even have an annual competition type of event where we would 
help teens work on projects all year and then be judged based on research, knowledge of 
entrepreneurship skills, and creativity. I wouldnât be in this program to make money, but a away 
to make funds to continue the program would be fees to enter the competition or workshops. I 
might consider pursuing this business idea, because it would be valuable for potential 
entrepreneurs to be ready for the real business world.
Question #2: Is a business that receives ideas from certain people and then give them to other 
people to implement a good business idea?
ChatGPT Answer: The business model you're describing, where a company receives ideas from 
one group of people and then passes them on to another group to implement, can potentially be a 
viable concept. However, there are several considerations and challenges you should be aware 
of:
â¢ 
Intellectual Property Issues:
â¢ Ensure that you have a clear system in place to handle intellectual property (IP) and 
protect the rights of the individuals submitting ideas. Establishing robust legal 
frameworks and agreements is crucial to avoid potential disputes.
â¢ Quality Control:
â¢ Maintaining the quality of the ideas you receive and ensuring that they are viable and 
feasible for implementation is essential. Implement a thorough vetting process to filter 
out impractical or unoriginal concepts.
â¢ Ethical Considerations:
â¢ Ethical concerns may arise if there is a perception that you are exploiting the creative 
input of individuals without adequately compensating them. Establish transparent and fair 
compensation models if the ideas lead to successful implementations.
â¢ Market Research:

â¢ Conduct thorough market research to understand the demand for such a service. Identify 
your target audience, including both idea contributors and implementers, and assess 
whether there is a genuine need for your intermediary role.
â¢ Networking and Partnerships:
â¢ Building a strong network is crucial. Establish relationships with both idea contributors 
and implementers. This may involve connecting with innovators, entrepreneurs, and 
businesses interested in new concepts.
â¢ Monetization Model:
â¢ Define how your business will generate revenue. Possible monetization models include 
charging a fee for idea submission, taking a percentage of profits from successful 
implementations, or offering subscription-based services.
â¢ Legal and Compliance:
â¢ Ensure that your business complies with relevant laws and regulations, especially 
concerning intellectual property, data protection, and privacy.
â¢ Marketing and Branding:
â¢ Create a strong brand and marketing strategy to attract both idea contributors and 
implementers. Clearly communicate the value proposition of your service to both sides of 
your target audience.
â¢ Feedback and Iteration:
â¢ Establish mechanisms for gathering feedback from both idea contributors and 
implementers. Use this feedback to continuously improve your processes and enhance the 
overall experience for your users.
â¢ Risk Management:
â¢ Recognize and mitigate potential risks associated with implementing ideas. This includes 
assessing the feasibility, scalability, and market readiness of the proposed concepts.
â¢ Technology Infrastructure:
â¢ 
Invest in a secure and efficient technology infrastructure to manage the submission, 
evaluation, and transfer of ideas. This may involve developing a user-friendly platform or 
leveraging existing collaboration tools.
While the concept of acting as an intermediary between idea generators and implementers can be 
intriguing, success will depend on the execution of your business model, the value you provide 
to both sides, and your ability to navigate legal and ethical considerations. Conduct thorough 
research and planning before launching such a venture.
Assessment: ChatGPT had quite a few concerns for this business idea including Intellectual 
property issues and ethical considerations. With this concept I would do all the necessary 
research; however, I feel that jumping through all the hoops I need to for the concept would not 
necessarily make this particular idea worth it.
Question #3: Is creating an online platform made specifically for teachers to share ideas on a 
good business idea?

ChatGPT Answer: Yes, creating an online platform specifically designed for teachers to share 
ideas can be a promising business idea. Here are some reasons why:
â¢ Community Building:
â¢ Teachers often appreciate opportunities to connect with peers, share experiences, and 
exchange ideas. An online platform can serve as a community hub for educators to build 
networks and support each other.
â¢ Resource Sharing:
â¢ Teachers frequently create and adapt educational materials. A platform that facilitates the 
sharing of lesson plans, teaching strategies, and resources can be immensely valuable in 
saving time and improving teaching quality.
â¢ Professional Development:
â¢ The platform can provide a space for continuous professional development. Teachers can 
learn from each other's experiences, discover new teaching methods, and stay updated on 
educational trends and best practices.
â¢ Collaboration Opportunities:
â¢ The platform can foster collaboration among teachers, allowing them to work together on 
projects, share insights, and even collaborate on curriculum development. This can 
enhance the overall quality of education.
â¢ Feedback and Support:
â¢ Teachers can use the platform to seek feedback on their teaching methods or specific 
challenges they are facing. This supportive community can provide valuable insights and 
encouragement.
â¢ 
Innovation Hub:
â¢ The platform can serve as an innovation hub where teachers can share and discover 
innovative approaches to teaching, incorporating technology, and addressing the evolving 
needs of education.
â¢ Marketplace for Educational Products:
â¢ Consider expanding the platform to include a marketplace where teachers can buy and 
sell educational materials, further monetizing the platform.
â¢ User-Friendly Interface:
â¢ Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to encourage widespread adoption. 
Teachers are more likely to engage with a platform that is easy to navigate and offers a 
positive user experience.
â¢ Privacy and Security Measures:
â¢ 
Implement robust privacy and security measures to protect the intellectual property of 
teachers and ensure a safe and secure environment for collaboration.
â¢ Monetization Strategies:
â¢ Explore various monetization strategies, such as premium subscriptions, sponsored 
content, or partnerships with educational product vendors. Offering additional features or 
premium content can incentivize users to subscribe.
â¢ Partnerships with Educational Institutions:

â¢ Consider forming partnerships with schools, school districts, or educational institutions to 
promote the platform and encourage widespread adoption.
â¢ Feedback and Iteration:
â¢ Actively seek feedback from teachers using the platform and iterate based on their needs. 
Continuous improvement is key to the long-term success of the platform.
Before launching the platform, conduct thorough market research to understand the specific 
needs and preferences of teachers. Engage with potential users to gather insights and ensure that 
the platform addresses real challenges in the teaching profession. If executed well, creating an 
online platform for teachers can not only be a profitable business but also contribute positively to 
the education community.
Assessment: ChatGPT gave some very good and positive insights on this business concept. One 
good suggestion it gave me on how to make money is to offer premium subscriptions and 
partnering with educational product vendors. Since charging teachers straight up to use the site
probably wouldnât make for an effective business model, making money in other ways is 
probably the best route. I would consider pursuing this business because it would be a great 
resource for teachers, and I donât think it would be too difficult to implement",,,,,,,,Nice work!,,,
SC,1,Fall,AI,20,"*Inserted into ChatGPT*: Generate 3 different opportunities, complete with unique solutions, 
potential markets, and suggested revenue models. Evaluate each. Provide solutions that other 
businesses can pay for the solution with. Have the market include ideas for Christmas shoppers 
this season. 
*Result copied and pasted from Chat GPT*: Problem: Christmas shoppers often struggle to 
find the perfect gifts for their loved ones, leading to stress and last-minute shopping.
Solution: Create a personalized virtual gift shopping assistance service. Implement AI-driven 
chatbots or virtual assistants that interact with users to understand recipients' preferences and 
suggest tailored gift ideas. Offer real-time support through chat or video calls with human 
shopping experts for a more personalized touch.
Potential Markets: Individual Christmas shoppers, retail stores partnering for a more 
personalized customer experience during the holiday season.
Revenue Model: Charge shoppers on a per-session basis for virtual assistant interactions. 
Establish partnerships with retailers for a commission on sales generated through the platform.
Evaluation: This solution addresses the seasonal stress of gift shopping. The personalized touch 
can attract Christmas shoppers looking for unique and thoughtful gifts. Revenue can be 
generated through direct user payments and partnerships with retailers.
Opportunity 2: Eco-Friendly Gift Wrapping and Delivery Service
Problem: During the holiday season, there's a surge in waste from traditional gift wrapping, and 
many people are seeking more sustainable alternatives.
Solution: Launch an eco-friendly gift wrapping and delivery service. Offer reusable and 
recyclable wrapping options made from sustainable materials. Provide a delivery service that 
ensures gifts reach recipients on time, beautifully wrapped in an environmentally friendly 
manner.
Potential Markets: Individuals looking for sustainable gift options, eco-conscious consumers, 
companies promoting green initiatives for corporate gifting.
Revenue Model: Charge a fee for each wrapped gift, with tiered pricing based on the size and 
complexity of the wrapping. Offer subscription plans for individuals or businesses with regular 
gifting needs.
Evaluation: This solution aligns with the increasing demand for eco-friendly practices during the 
holiday season. The subscription model provides a steady revenue stream, and businesses could 
pay for customized corporate gifting solutions.
Opportunity 3: Virtual Christmas Caroling Experience
Problem: Traditional Christmas caroling may be challenging due to distance, and people are 
looking for new ways to celebrate the season together.
Solution: Develop a virtual Christmas caroling experience platform. Allow users to organize and 
join virtual caroling sessions with friends and family. Provide features like customizable 
playlists, virtual backgrounds, and the ability to invite guest performers for a unique and festive 
experience.
Potential Markets: Families and friends looking for virtual holiday activities, companies 
organizing virtual holiday events for employees.

generated through user payments for private sessions and corporate partnerships seeking to 
organize memorable virtual employees.
All of these ideas from ChatGPT are excellent ideas for market potential for the holiday 
season approaching soon. All of these opportunities could bring in huge revenue because people 
look for gift wrapping services, want more personalized gifts, and want more virtual options and 
to pick and choose when it comes to Christmas caroling. From my personal rankings, my number
one for this generation would have to be the sustainable Christmas present wrapping. Every 
single year, so much paper gets wasted and thrown out in the trash from unwrapping presents. I 
think that this would be a great idea because it would save the earth and it would bring awareness
to the issue. Creating a business like this for example would be extremely beneficial for the 
market potential and for the planet. Spending money on a solution like providing more 
sustainable options would bring more awareness for the issue that is experienced every single 
year. The second option for my personal ranking is the virtual Christmas caroling. The problem 
that the organization of Christmas caroling experiences is that listeners donât seem to care for it.

MD,1,Fall,AI,20,"For this assignment, I asked ChatGPT âCan you come up with three separate business models related to theme parks that include potential markets, revenue models, and how large each potential market is?â

Output One: Virtual Theme Park Experiences (Worst Idea)

The AI suggested that the potential market for a virtual theme park experience could be individuals worldwide that may not have physical access to a theme park as well as families and gamers that are interested in experiencing a new theme park innovation. The suggested revenue model includes either subscription based access or online purchases of virtual tickets and merchandise. According to ChatGPT, the market size for the global virtual reality market is projected to hit 92 billion by 2027. I dislike this idea because as a theme park and roller coaster enthusiast who spends a lot of time researching new innovations in the industry, I cannot see this being a sustainable business. I think that anyone who would buy into the idea of a virtual theme park would maybe go once to experience it, and then never return. The point of a theme park is to feel immersed in the land, and be able to admire the detail and ingenuity of those that created the park. Not to mention the fact that you cannot recreate a roller coaster experience online. I think that this idea may gain traction as a novelty for a few months, but will not be able to sustain itself long enough to make a profit. I would not consider this output for my project. 

Output Two: Queue Management Solutions

The AI suggested that the potential market for a queue management system could be theme parks and amusement centers, as well as entertainment event organizers. The suggested revenue models for this product include licensing fees, consultation and implementation services, as well as data analytics services. According to ChatGPT, the market size for this product is quite large considering the theme park market is valued at over 50 billion and it is expected to keep growing. I like this idea, especially considering that I had an idea regarding managing queues a while back. I have seen that Disney in particular is receiving a lot of complaints about their queue management, and the great majority of the comments that I have been seeing have mentioned that they donât feel like spending the money to go back to Disney parks until they have made the experience more enjoyable. I definitely think that theme parks are looking to innovate in this area, so I do like the concept. That being said, I do not think that I would choose this output for my project because I like my existing idea more. 

Output Three: Themed Merchandise Subscription Box Service (Best Idea)

The AI suggested that the potential market for themed merchandise subscription boxes is theme park enthusiasts as well as collectors and fans. The suggested revenue models for this product include subscription fees, limited edition releases, and collaborations with theme parks. According to ChatGPT, the market size for this product is very large, considering the merchandise market is valued at over 280 billion. I love this idea, and have dreamed of having a subscription box with different merchandise from my favorite theme parks. There is a huge community of die hard fans for roller coasters, and I think that an opportunity to get more merchandise would always be welcomed. I love this idea so much, and I hope that one day it will become a reality. This is the only output that I am really considering for my project, and it may be better than the idea I already had before.

The global mental health and wellness market is expected to reach $121 billion
by 2027, driven by increasing awareness and demand for mental health services.
All the problems seem like smart entrepreneurial pursuits fit with a profitable and workable solution that
would be able to gain traction in the real world at least based on what I am aware of when it comes to 
marketability. When it comes to ranking them in terms of feasibility for me, I think the virtual stress relief
workshops centered around mental health would be number one for me because I am a psychology 
major with a concentration in mental health, so this kind of business would be right up my alley in terms 
of qualifications and actual ability to make it happen. Next, Iâd probably feel most connected to the 
Smart Item Locator Tags because I would consider myself a forgetful individual who would strongly 
benefit in my personal life from such an item. As I am a part of the target market, I feel like I would be 
dedicated to the purpose of the product and therefore why I feel like it is relatively feasible for me. And 
lastly, I do not feel any special connection to a food delay tracker app, so I believe itâs the least feasible 
idea for me to pursue. As for which one has the biggest market, ChatGPT was able to determine the 
mental health field is expected to reach 121 billion dollars which is great for me because it is my top 
choice for an entrepreneurial pursuit and the one I feel like Iâd be most qualified to accomplish in real 
life. As for the EVP project, I feel like the mental health one is definitely a contender for which one Iâd like
to do considering its connection to my life, but Iâd still like to weigh my options from previous weeks and 
also to see if I can come up with any other original ideas.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
NN,1,Fall,AI,20,"In this week's daily practice I talked about developing a makeup app that people could use to determine the best products for their skin/facial features. I decided to stay within that realm for this ChatGPT opportunity assignment. 

I typed in, ""generate 3 differrent opportunities within the beauty industry, complete with unique solution, potential markets, and suggested revenue models."" I also ranked them as well. 

Opportunity 1: Personalized Skincare Consultations (Rank: #2)

Unique Solution: Develop a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to analyze users' skin conditions based on uploaded photos, lifestyle factors, and environmental considerations. The app then provides personalized skincare routines, recommends specific products, and offers real-time advice for maintaining healthy skin.

Potential Market: Target a broad market, including individuals seeking personalized skincare solutions, those with specific skin concerns, and people looking to improve their skincare routines. Collaborate with dermatologists, estheticians, and skincare brands to enhance credibility and expand the user base.

Affiliate Marketing: Partner with skincare brands and earn a commission for every user who purchases recommended products through the app.
In-App Purchases: Provide the option to purchase skincare products directly within the app, earning a percentage of each sale.
Opportunity 2: Sustainable Beauty Products Marketplace (Rank: #3)

Unique Solution: Create an online marketplace dedicated to sustainable and eco-friendly beauty products. Curate a selection of brands committed to environmentally friendly practices, including cruelty-free, vegan, and zero-waste products.

Potential Market: Target environmentally conscious consumers who prioritize sustainability in their beauty routines. Collaborate with indie brands and established companies that align with eco-friendly values. This market includes individuals looking for alternatives to traditional beauty products that often come in non-recyclable packaging.

Revenue Model:

Commission from Sales: Charge a commission on each sale made through the platform, incentivizing brands to join and promote their products.
Subscription Box Service: Offer a subscription box containing a selection of curated sustainable beauty products, generating recurring revenue.
Educational Content Partnerships: Partner with environmental organizations to create educational content on the platform, sponsored by eco-friendly beauty brands.
Opportunity 3: Virtual Beauty Try-Ons for E-Commerce (Rank: #1)

Unique Solution: Develop an augmented reality (AR) app that allows users to virtually try on makeup and skincare products before making a purchase. Utilize facial recognition technology to provide accurate and realistic virtual representations of how products will look on different skin tones and types.

Potential Market: Target online shoppers who are hesitant to purchase beauty products without trying them first. Collaborate with e-commerce platforms, beauty brands, and retailers to integrate the AR try-on feature into their websites and apps.

I think that the virtual beauty try-ons for e-commerce is the most feasible. I discussed something similar in one of my opportunity ideas. I thought that the revenue model of licensing to brands is really smart, because it allows the idea to make somewhat of a profit and also the idea helps makeup brands sell their products as well. Overall, I think it's a really good idea. ",,,,,,,,Good work but I'm afraid the assignments are to be completed on a daily basis and not completed all at once.

CR,0,Fall,AI,20," ( 3 new business ideas / inventions yet to be explored - with market evaluation )

1. Personalized Health and Wellness Plans for Remote Workers

With the increase in remote work, there's a need for personalized health and wellness plans that cater to the unique challenges of working from home.

Offer a service that creates customized health and wellness plans for remote workers. This could include personalized fitness routines, mental health resources, nutrition plans, and ergonomic workspace suggestions.

Utilize technology such as AI and wearables to gather data and provide tailored recommendations. You could monetize through subscription plans or partnerships with companies looking to support the well-being of their remote employees.

Wellness plans are super intriguing and a huge business idea for Chatgpt. I see alot of these propositions are wellness and health related. Obviously the market for medicine and wellness is very valuable and could be a really good money maker. There is a huge market for this due to the fact that remote work has increased alot. This would be a service that could be sold for many people and used by many people. It could be offered through the business you work for, by partnering with these businesses you could also get your name out there alot easier.

2. Smart Home Energy Management System

Idea: Develop an integrated system that monitors and manages home energy consumption. This could include smart sensors, AI algorithms, and a user-friendly interface to optimize energy usage, reduce waste, and save costs.

Market Evaluation: The global smart home market is expected to grow significantly as more people seek energy-efficient solutions. With increasing awareness of environmental sustainability, a smart home energy management system could appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. The market evaluation would depend on the affordability, effectiveness, and user-friendliness of the system.

This is a really cool idea, And its also correct the smart home system market is growing and making it a better and cheaper way of making things better for families around the world. By starting and selling a product like this it could benefit alot of people. Like i say about alot of these businesses its easy to try and partner with a home security business or sell the product itself.

3. Smart Waste Management System for Cities

Idea: Design a comprehensive waste management system for cities that utilizes IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors to monitor waste levels in bins. The system would optimize waste collection routes, reduce overflow, and enhance overall efficiency.

Market Evaluation: As urbanization continues, efficient waste management becomes crucial. Smart city solutions are gaining traction globally. The market potential lies in providing municipalities with cost-effective and environmentally friendly waste management solutions. The success would depend on the scalability, cost-effectiveness, and integration capabilities of the system.

How do we fix climate change? This is a good start, I feel like everywhere around the world we have always had trouble regulating our waste management which causes polution and ultimatly leads to what they call "" global warming "" If we could actually generate a system that could allow for orginization and proper waste dispursement it would easily be a really good business idea that could easily be succesful cause its most likeley something you could sell to the governement. The market is there, but i cant imagine this idea hasnt been already explored.

GS,1,Fall,AI,20,"ways Pinterest can be used by wedding photographers

I have recently started using pinterest for marketing purposes for photography so I was curious in the way it could be used other than what I had thought of. ChatGPT brought up using client testimonials as pins. Im curious in the ways I could do that with it still being aesthetically pleasing and if using testimonials would drive traffic to my website and translate into bookings.

how can i use photography client testimonials on pinterest to drive website traffic

ChatGPT suggests creating a client testimonial board and calling it either âclient loveâ or âhappy clientsâ and putting pins in that of what people have said about their experience with me taking their photos. It said a few other things too but overall I think all the things ChatGPT said would be more useful on Facebook or instagram. Not pinterest. Pinterest people come for inspiration, not to see testimonials.

what key words should I use on pinterest as a michigan wedding photographer

ChatGPT had great suggestions when I asked this. It listed many, I will attach the list below. Most of these are location based. I am interested in if I tag my photos with âDetroit wedding photographerâ if that would translate into more Detroit wedding bookings. How would that work with out of state weddings? These are all great suggestions for key words to use on pinterest.

TS,0,Fall,AI,20,"Generate three business ideas in the field of hunting

1. Outdoor Adventure and Hunting Retreat

2. Custom Hunting Gear and Apparel

3. Hunting Education and Training Services

I think the potential market is in the hunting field, directed at people who hunt.  I think each of these has a big opportunity, but I also think its a very competitive market. Thinking about the EVP assignment, number 2 would be a legitimate opposition for me. 
Feasible rankings 2,3,1 ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
ZT,1,Fall,AI,20,"Prompt: Generate 3 different opportunities, complete with unique solutions, potential
markets, and suggested revenue models.
Opportunity 1: Sustainable Transportation Solutions
- 
Solution: Develop an electric bicycle sharing platform with swappable batteries for urban
and suburban areas.
- 
Potential Market:
- Urban commuters looking for a cost-effective and eco-friendly mode of
transportation.
- 
College campuses, where students need convenient transportation between
classes.
- 
Tourist destinations with scenic routes for bike rentals.
- 
Corporate campuses to promote eco-friendly commuting among employees.
- Revenue Model:
- 
Subscription-based services: Offer monthly or annual membership plans for

Pay-per-ride fees: Charge users on a per-ride basis for occasional users.
- 
Battery swap fees: Generate revenue by offering convenient battery swap stations
and charging a fee for swapping batteries.
- Advertising partnerships:
- 
Collaborate with local businesses to display ads on bike stations or mobile app.
â Analysis: I do not think this is a very original idea as this has been done before and
was just launched in my home town and is working successfully. Not to mention it
was just launched just on CMUâs campus during the end of this past spring
semester and has also been doing ok considering the prices. However out of all of the
prompts ChatGPT has generated I do think this is the most feasible as it has already
been done before so there would be competition, however the prices be minute/mile
could be cut lower for people to favor this company compared to the others.
Opportunity 2: Personalized Online Fitness and Wellness Programs
- 
Solution: Create a platform that offers personalized fitness and wellness programs based
on users' goals, preferences, and health data.
- 
Potential Market:
- 
Fitness enthusiasts seeking customized workout plans and diet advice.
- 
Individuals with specific health conditions looking for tailored exercise and
nutrition guidance.
- Health and wellness professionals who want to offer personalized programs to
their clients.
- 
Corporate wellness programs interested in promoting employee health.
- Revenue Model:

- 
Subscription fees: Charge users a monthly or annual fee for access to personalized
programs.
- 
In-app purchases: Offer premium content, such as advanced workout routines or
nutritional supplements.
- 
Licensing to professionals: License the platform to healthcare providers or fitness
trainers for a fee.
- Affiliate partnerships: Partner with fitness equipment manufacturers and
supplement brands for referral commissions.
â Analysis: This also wasnât very original and there are multiple programs, apps,
electrical equipment, and jobs that6 do exactly what ChatGPT is describing. This
would be beneficial for everyone but yet is still not that unique idea.
Opportunity 3: Sustainable Food Delivery Service
- 
Solution: Create a food delivery service that prioritizes sustainability by using electric
vehicles, reusable packaging, and sourcing food from local, eco-friendly suppliers.
- 
Potential Market:
- 
Environmentally conscious consumers looking for eco-friendly food delivery
options.
- Urban areas with high demand for food delivery services and eco-conscious
populations.
- Restaurants and food vendors interested in reducing their environmental impact.
- 
Event planners seeking sustainable catering services.
- Revenue Model:
- Delivery fees: Charge a fee for delivering food orders to customers.
- 
Subscription plans: Offer premium subscription options for free delivery or
discounts.
- 
Supplier partnerships: Collaborate with local, sustainable food suppliers and
charge a fee for their inclusion on the platform.
- 
Event catering: Provide eco-friendly catering services for weddings, corporate
events, and parties with customized pricing.
â Analysis: This idea I would say is my favorite of the ideas that ChatGPT has
generated. This idea is an edited idea from doordash where other people deliver the
food but the added perk is that ChatGPT is making it economically sustainable. The
only thing where I do not see this the most feasible at the moment is when adding
everything up is it really economically safe? Like a Tesle for instance, it's
economically safe on its own but isn't when taking into consideration how the Tesla
is made.
Total Analysis:
I do think that the most feasible would be the bike idea first then the food delivery and
then finally the online fitness programs. I also think in that order these are the most
potential ideas to get âbigâ and be successful.",,,,,,,,Good analysis!,,,
MA,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"I watched the oppurtunities processing video and heard some interesting points made, the speaker talked about how the oppurtunities he always takes are in a field which he already knows alot about. this makes sense to me because lots of oppurtunities come to me all the time but some in areas where I dont know alot about what I'm doing which makes it hard to know where to get started. I will start in fields where I already have previous knowledge and experience in in order to get the most out of my efforts.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
MB,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"This week I listened to the podcast episode titled âReturn on InvestmentâBrian Brasch.â In this 
episode, Brian Brasch gave some very good insights on how to create a successful business. One point 
that Brasch made was that there are basically two aspects in the world of business, which are finance 
and law. He mentioned that if an entrepreneur knows at least one of these two, they have a step up on 
other businesses. This is one thing I need to do more of when considering whether a business idea is 
worthwhile, because numbers and logistics are good for bringing the business idea into reality. Another 
insight that Brasch gave was that consistency is key in the world of business. This is important to 
consider when discussing process and specifics within a business to maximize profitability.
With these exercises, I learned that I need to focus more on details and reactions to needs and 
opportunities. Asking ChatGPT about what it thought of my business ideas was very helpful because I 
then explored the weak spots of certain ideas that I thought could be good if executed properly. I think 
that these exercises of noticing opportunities throughout the day and then evaluating them was very 
useful for making a habit of it. Although some days it got tedious, I thought that exercising the thought 
process every day helped me to get into the habit of thinking more like an entrepreneur.",,,,,,,,Thanks for putting in the work!,,,
SC,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"
From these past few weeks, I have learned a significant amount of information from 
listening to three different entrepreneurs. Out of the three different entrepreneurs I listened to on 
the podcast, my favorite one would have to be Brian Brasch. I learned the most beneficial 
information about possibly being an entrepreneur one day. From this specific entrepreneur, I 
learned that you can notice entrepreneurial opportunities every single day, return on investment, 
and how this specific entrepreneur can handle his ten businesses in a busy lifestyle he has. This 
process changed me in a way of understanding that you are capable of doing anything if you 
have motivation and that your mind is set on success. Another key message I learned from an 
entrepreneur in this course was Derrin Hill. Something that I learned from him in his podcast 
episode was noticing patterns within responses. He claims the same problems and answers 
dalways happened while pursuing and being an entrepreneur. He claims how important it is to 
have open and honest conversations. It is important to take a different approach while falling into
the same problems and issues being an entrepreneur. 
Something that I struggled with during these exercises the past three weeks was 
managing to analyze three issues and opportunities during my day and making them business 
opportunities. To add to that, finding potential markets and other businesses that can contribute 
to the possible opportunities. This was a struggle for me because it was hard in some situations 
that I dealt with during the day, to create a business plan with potential market ideas for them. 
Something that I gathered from these assessments was to always be on the lookout for potential 
opportunities and possibilities for just about anything that you motor a minor issue or 
inconvenience for. When it came down to using Chat GPT, I really enjoyed it. I think it is 
extremely neat to see how artificial intelligence works and how fast it can generate a solution for 
our weekly tasks. To add to that, it also has helped more understand what potential markets are 
out in the world along with how problems and opportunities can be dealt with. A con I had with 
using ChatGPT is generating the same response quite often. I had to make my solutions more 
themed by the third week of using ChatGPT. I will use ChatGPT in the future while following 
academic integrity by only using it for generating possible ideas for assignments extremely 
similar to those we have experienced in this course. If I could recommend one thing in this 
course for these assignments, I would recommend using ChatGPT more. It really helped me 
understand what exactly I should be looking for in these assignments. For example, potential 
markets, business solutions, etc. To add to that, I would recommend adding women 
entrepreneurs to your podcast. I think it would be very inspiring for college females to listen to. 
",,,,,,,,"I'd love to interview female serial entrepreneurs, it is a great idea. Please let me know if you know of any that have started multiple businesses. Finding serial entrepreneurs is the tough part because they are usually busy creating another startup.",,,
BC2,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"I think doing these daily practices helped me in the way that I was more aware of things going on
around me. I was looking for way more opportunities than I normally would and writing the opportunity 
down as well. I am nowhere near the experience level of the entrepreneurs on the podcast, but 
everything comes with time. The practice also changed how I observed people because you can learn a 
lot about someone and something just by observing their emotions. ChatGPT was also a surprisingly 
good tool to generate ideas. I liked the use of ChatGPT a lot because it generated opportunities for me 
which gave me a little bit of a break. Overall, the daily practices were an easy but effective way to change
how I find opportunities because they forced me to pay attention to things while doing day-to-day 
activities.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
JC,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"1. Consistency in Identifying Opportunities:
I followed the rubric's guidelines consistently when it came to recognizing issues, coming
up with fixes, pinpointing target audiences, and recommending revenue models for various 
prompts. This made it easier to keep things organized and guaranteed that every detail was taken 
into account.
2. Growth in Creativity and Insight:
I observed improvement in my capacity to come up with unique and creative business 
prospects via practice. I was able to approach challenges from many perspectives and gain a 
more nuanced grasp of potential answers by paying attention to diverse suggestions.
3. Adaptation of Learning Style:
For me, this method made clear how important iterative learning is. The process of 
coming up with ideas, getting input, and honing my strategy allowed me to understand the 
requirements for opportunity assessment. It reaffirmed the notion that education is a continuous, 
dynamic process.
4. Reflection on Meta-Learning:
I discovered that this exercise's iterative structure and feedback greatly improved my 
capacity to recognize and assess opportunities. Analyzing my own thinking and making 
adjustments in response to criticism were essential components of my development.
5. Experience with ChatGPT:
Pros:
ï· 
ChatGPT was really helpful in making suggestions, honing concepts, and presenting a 
variety of viewpoints.
ï· 
It worked well to simulate brainstorming meetings and produce original ideas.
ï· 
The adaptability of the instrument made it possible to investigate other areas of 
entrepreneurship.
Cons:
ï· 
Despite ChatGPT's strength, occasionally it produced concepts that needed further work 
or were too general.
ï· 
Sometimes the limitations of context knowledge resulted in outputs that required more 
explanation.
6. Maintaining Academic Integrity:
It's crucial to use ChatGPT as a tool for idea generation and insight rather than as a 
source of pre-made solutions in order to uphold academic honesty. Ensuring that the final 
product reflects critical thinking and personal understanding requires cross-referencing the 
generated information with existing knowledge and refining the result.
7. Suggestions for Improvement:
ï· 
Periodic group discussions or peer reviews could provide fresh viewpoints and encourage
cooperative learning.
ï· 
More industry-specific or real-world challenge-related prompts could improve 
application in the actual world.
ï· 
Promoting the investigation of new technology or trends in entrepreneurship may 
increase the range of available options.
Conclusion:
In general, this task has really improved my ability to recognize business opportunities. 
Growth has been steady thanks to ChatGPT's support and the iterative approach. The 
significance of introspection, flexibility, and upholding academic integrity was underscored by 
the meta-learning component. I want to use this method going ahead as I understand how 
important iteration and ongoing improvement are to my learning process.",,,,,,,,Fantastic reflection and effort! Thanks for showing up and putting in the work to re-train your brain.,,,
MD,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"For this last assignment, I listened to the podcast where Brian Gramm speaks about opportunity identification. One part that stuck out to me in particular is when Gramm spoke about how his process of identifying potential business ideas consists a lot of the thought âIf I was put in a place to buy this product, would I?â and I think that I tried to do that throughout this project. A lot of the business opportunities that I came up with are something that I really wish would exist in my life. I think that through the last three weeks I have gotten better at being more mindful of whether or not using a product was a positive or negative experience, and began to think more about how the things around me could be improved. I also really enjoyed utilizing ChatGPT to brainstorm business ideas, and thought that it had some really interesting perspectives that I wouldnât have come up with. The only thing that I believe could be improved on this assignment is an example of what each weekâs responses may look like. I say this because I was a bit confused at what each response was supposed to look like at first, so I think that having a quality example that students can look to for guidance would be very helpful!",,,,,,,,"Great suggestion with the examples, my hesitation is that part of what we want students to get used to is dealing with ambiguity/uncertainty and this is just a small low stakes way to do that. The other is that I have found when sharing examples to often it limits creativity or effort but I can see if I put in the best examples it could reinforce what is in the rubric.",,,
RG,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"Throughout the past three weeks, I feel like I learned a lot from these practices. Initially, I did not think these practices would impact me much, but by the end, I realized how much this has changed my way of thinking. I also learned that learning doesn't have to be done inside a building and at a desk. I was able to learn a lot about entrepreneurship by just going through my daily tasks. Although there is controversy surrounding the use of AI, like ChatGPT, in an academic setting, I felt that it created great ideas with plans for how to achieve these different ideas. When used appropriately, I believe that ChatGPT is a great tool.

Things that worked well were the blending of ideas from psychology, technology, and business worked well to create new and clever solutions to pursue, and focusing on what the people want and like helped come up with better and more attractive business ideas. Things that I believe didn't work well were that even though the ideas were well-researched, I didn't completely foresee the possible difficulties that might come up when trying to put certain features into action, like collaborations with universities.

Overall, I thought this was a great, and unique, learning experience. This was something I had never done in my years of schooling and think that students after me would benefit from these exercises.",,,,,,,,Great work! Thanks for letting it change you. You may want to see in these coming weeks how automatic it is now that you don't have to do it for an assignment.,,,
MG,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"I listened to the podcast and the main thing that I learned is you have to view the world like everything has the potential to be an opportunity. It is all about the way you think, think about how something may be better. It is looking at something and thinking about how you could maybe improve something that a lot of people would appreciate to be improved. It helped me to look at things and when I don;t like how they are working to think about how I could fix it and possibly take action to that. 

I liked being able to use chat gpt because this allowed me to be able to more focus on solution for things I don't really struggle with and so a solution may come to me a little bit easier. I could use it in the future if I need help with a topic for a paper adn can't think of what to write about.",,,,,,,,Tools are great starting points as long as you know what to do with them.,,,
JH,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"Compared to the experienced entrepreneurs from the podcast, I still very much feel like a novice
when it comes to figuring out entrepreneurial opportunities within daily life. From the daily noticing 
episode, where these professional entrepreneurs discussed being able to analyze multiple opportunities 
throughout their typical day and can estimate a potential solutionâs market size as well as determine if 
itâs a worthwhile opportunity to pursue considering its return on investment-all within a few seconds is 
incredible. Itâs something a regular person like me cannot do immediately and instead I need lots of time 
and energy to assess if it would be a worthwhile idea to pursue. I also thought it was impressive they 
could figure out aspects like the âdominant playerâ and if they are appealing to smaller markets as well. 
Thatâs just something I would not even think of, but stuff I am starting to think about now after 
completing the three-week habit building journey. 
I think this process was able to change me a little bit, because now I feel like I genuinely listen to 
people complaining like my boyfriend, family, or friends and Iâm able to think of solutions through an 
entrepreneurial mindset. About learning about how I learn, I feel like I learn relatively quick and 
adaptively, but I still need to take time to sit back and really put effort into my thought processes or 
sometimes I tend to glaze over the big picture just to get the assignment done quickly. What worked well
is that at the end of the day I was able to come up with problems after thinking about my day more in 
depth and what did not go well was that I probably should have dedicated more energy into 
entrepreneurial thinking in the moment so I can be quicker on my feet when it comes to noticing these 
opportunities. I think when it comes to real-life learning applications, I learned it is important for me to 
specifically dedicate my time and energy into assignments instead of just coasting through them to gain 
life experience instead of temporary academic validation. 
Using Chat GPT was fine, I donât know how often Iâll use it for other classes because I am very 
worried about plagiarism and using ideas other than my own. Pros were that it was helpful to receive 
help on generating ideas so it wasnât just everyday of me thinking for myself, but instead I could take a 
break and analyze other ideas that werenât self-generated while cons would probably be it would often 
repeat answers and it was hard to find a unique prompt to get unique business ideas. If I was ever 
interested in using it again, I may use it just to help generate like essay ideas or similar just to maintain 
academic integrity so Iâm not having a whole essay written on ChatGPT. For future classes, I feel like 
being more laidback about the due dates would be ideal (which I believe you were because I turned in a 
couple late and didnât get docked, but Iâm not sure how far this extends) because life happens. During 
the project, I got horribly sick and fell behind a couple of days because I was bedridden with a fever. I 
also had a Halloween football game for the marching band which had me out of the house from 1pm to 
midnight, and work/classes before my call time. So, life happens, and this class wonât always be my top 
priority so I think leniency with these daily assignments is a very good thing that should be continued. ",,,,,,,,Fantastic self awareness and reflection!,,,
NN,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"The podcast I listened to was the one with Derrin Hill regarding the business model. Throughout the podcast, there was discussion on the criteria used to evaluate business models, how it has evolved over the years, and what fuels the big opportunity ideas. 

When talking about the ""business model,"" the evaluation method is somewhat sophisticated, but that hasn't always been the case. It has evolved over the years to where now it's a pretty sophisticated evaluation that allows them to look at different business models that have specific key components. Components are rated with a ""point"" system-- almost like a rubric of sorts. Some questions asked when evaluating are, ""Is the business model single revenue stream or multiple revenue streams?"" ""Are they one-time things?"" ""What kind of margin profile is there in the business?"" I also learned that the extent to which you have margin is the extent to which you can make mistakes. 

Another point that was brought up was ""focusing on the big things"" or ""big issues."" Some examples of this are ""How do you solve illiteracy?"" or, ""How do you get access to clean drinking water for people who need it?"" I think I could do a better job at focusing on the big things. I think my biggest downfall is that in all of my opportunity/solution assignments is that I have been primarily focusing on things that affect/interest me within my own personal environment. Seldom have I thought about these ""big picture problems."" Listening to that part of the podcast really made me think about that and how I want to start not only thinking of opportunities/solutions to problems in my own life, but to the bigger social and economic issues people are facing throughout the world.

1.Honest assessment of how you did compared to all the experienced entrepreneurs in 
developing your ability to notice entrepreneurial opportunities.
To start off, my ability to notice entrepreneurial opportunities has progressed over the 
three weeks. At the start, it took me longer to understand/grasp the mindset. As an 
experienced entrepreneur had discussed in the podcast, he would look at almost 
everything as an opportunity and find the problem and think deeper about that market 
and revenue market. I started to get the hang of it such as finding opportunities in 
problems I found in school, daily life, friends, and my environment. I have more work to 
do when it comes to noticing entrepreneurial opportunities, but I have made a great 
deal of progress and can relate to some of the experienced entrepreneurial mindsets 
and strategies I tried to do during the week.

What did you learn about how you learn? What worked well what didn't? How might 
you transfer what helped you learn to other aspects of your growth and learning 
journey?
The first thing I learned about how I learn is by reptation and practice. At first when 
seeing something new it helps me to understand and learn it is to keep practicing it and 
get the hang of it. It also helps me to receive feedback, especially at the earlier point of 
me learning the subject because I can apply that to my next assignment and learn from 
it. I also can learn about how I learn from learning how to adjust and switch my mindset 
while learning such as these daily assignments. Something that did not work well when 
learning is overthinking and trying to be a perfectionist on everything, especially with 
creative thinking. I can transfer what helped me to learn other aspect of my growth and 
learning journey is to stay alert and take moments like this to pause and see what is 
working and what is not and adjust accordingly.

What was your experience like with ChatGPT? Pro's versus con's of using the tool? How 
might you use it going forward while maintaining academic integrity?
My experience with CHATGPT initially, was that it was not giving me creative or unique 
generations, I felt like it was very bland. I also noticed that you must be very specific and 
ask exactly what information you need. It was surprising how fast it was and how much 
information it can give you. The pro of using the tool is that it can be a really good aid, 
such as asking to help you format, explain how to do something or give your ideas. The 
con of the tool is that it can be used in the wrong ways and could be used to do the 
critical thinking for you. I might use it going forward while maintaining academic 
integrity is by asking it for ideas on how to go forward such as how to organize the 
information or ideas I already have. Or using my exact information and asking how to 
improve it. I could also use it to help me explain a topic or to breakdown an explanation 
on an assignment.

Is there anything you think I should start, stop, or continue doing with this exercise for 
the next class to make it a better learning experience?
I really enjoyed this exercise and feel as if it is a great learning experience and should be 
continued. The only recommendation I have to make it a better learning experience is 
possibly reducing the number of days. It was 6 days, which was sometimes hard to keep 
up with, and with weekends and other school and life related things having it a few days 
shorter daily might benefit and not make the end of week ideas less creative and 
detailed.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
CR,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"I really liked the interview with brian brasch as he talked about some things and i liked the insight he gave us specifically on Being gutsy enough to take the risk and start the business. As well as being knowledgeable in some fascet weather its accounting or legal side of things. I liked what he said, I do think that it isnt neccassary to have those skills when you can just try and find someone and hire them out to do those things for you while you keep the creative juices flowing. 

After the past three weeks it has been really interesting and cool to go throughout each and everyday and look at things while trying to make them better. Alot of my life ive done things like this but would never take the time to write them down and then I would forget my ideas. Its cool seeing real life entrepreneurs go throughout there day trying to figure out ways to make things better and that is how i view it. "" how can we make this better "" was the mindset that I had to have while doing these excersizes and there were alot of times that I had no ideas what so ever either cause I was having trouble coming up with ideas or just because I didnt go through very much that day and I had to get really creative. This process of going through my day trying to make things better is something I will continue to do going forward, I go back to what we learned about having a growth mindset and how important it is to think that way. I know more than anything that is going to be something I want to continue using and expiriementing with. I also think its a tool I can use by not limiting myself, If I go through homework assignments or tests i believe it could help me be a better student which is something I struggle with.

Overall I saw a lot of growth over the past few weeks and it has been really good to test my brain and force it to see things from the point of view of "" what can we change / fix to make something better "" If the whole goal is to make the world a better place I think its important that we have that mindset constantly. Chatgpt was also a cool tool to use in these scenerios and while it is something i was already previously used to using it was cool emersing into its "" creative "" side and seeing what ideas it could generate, It was really cool and i do think it can be beneficial in helping in that realm of learning. Chatgpt is a tool i could see myself using in the future to help me generate ideas or even help me make sure im staying on target/on task. It helps and lists things that you can take with a grain of salt and build off of. More than anything I think that is a good building block tool to help you build ideas off of and see if they could be imporoved.

I really enjoyed these excersizes and liked how it trained my brain to think differently even though at times it was dificult. The only thing i would change is instead of trying to generate so many ideas focus on what those ideas are and how you could actually make them work, I liked how this past week we looked at market evaluations and how we can make them happen in real life. Overall i think it was a fun thing and useful thing to learn and work on and im glad we did it. ",,,,,,,,Great job. Thanks for showing up and putting in the work!,,,
AR,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"I listened to opportunity identification by Brian Brasch. At first I looked at this as an everyday annoying task rather than changing the way I think.

As I went on even the days I missed turning in the assignments I looked at everything as an opportunity. Compared to the other entrepreneurs on the podcasts I realized that they all have a quick step by step way of thinking when evaluating a problem. These people also were able to think in more of a money making and analytical way rather than holding myself back because I'm a college student with little time or resources to actually take advantage. 


Overall I do think this has shifted my mind to think more about money making opportunities and also being more creative about ideas and what ways they could be used and what areas of business they could be used. I also learned that I think in more of an inventor type way rather than an entrepreneur way.  

Chat GPT has its ups and downs because it does give good information but some of it is very generic. The good thing about it though is that it gives so many ideas and its speed of giving them. 

One thing I would change or modify would be the everyday same thing because I started catching myself either saying the same thing or saying stuff that really did not correlate with what you wanted. I would much rather have it so you could have 10 or so of your favorite great experiences and problems and elaborate on those more in depth.",,,,,,,,"How much bandwidth you have is definitely one of those step by step ways of deciding what an opportunity is for you. THough sometimes you can come back to ideas. I just had a former student reach back out to me to share where he was at with an idea that he came up with while in school.

I'm curious what you think of it: https://youtu.be/02T3KMahcdY?feature=shared",,,
MS,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"So overall I did better than I thought I would do. I would not say I am a master at it or even at an intermediate level of opportunity identification. Guys like Brian Brasch in the podcast were very impressive in how he explained he could run opportunities through his head in such a short time. I think the area I improved most was at the beginning of the day sort of getting my mind right and telling myself to keep my eyes open throughout the day. One thing I did for example is if I was sitting in class, or my room, or walking to class, if a random thought came to mind I would quickly put it in my notes so I didn't forget about it. One area of improvement I need is to look at how realistic the solution could be to certain problems as well as practical ways to complete the solution. There were many times I would throw out an idea that wasn't the most realistic for me. I still think it was good to do though because I got to reflect on the few solutions I would have interest in doing and I could accomplish them realistically. The biggest way it changed me was by looking at the world through a different lens. Trying to identify the little problems in everyday life was pretty difficult the last few weeks. I think it's something that will improve through life. Opportunity identification and creating an entrepreneurial mindset doesn't come over time or even over a few weeks, you kind of have to take it day by day. 

My overall experience with ChatGPT was interesting. I think it is a very powerful tool entrepreneurs can use but it has its flaws. What I liked was how quickly it could come up with some unique solutions. You could keep asking it to come up with stuff and it would write something new every time. The bad thing about it was how unrealistic some of the ideas were. Some of the ""inventions"" it came up with were so complex that I kind of threw the idea out the window. 

I enjoyed this activity. I think it challenges you to open your mind and become optimistic about every opportunity you notice. I feel like the most successful entrepreneurs have come up with thousands of ideas but only need one to hit the mark. I think this was a great activity for an intro to entrepreneurship. It gets your mind thinking in the right direction. ",,,,,,,,Great analysis! Thanks for putting in the work.,,,
GS,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"Brian Gramm talks about how if he would have a problem and could think of a business idea to fix it, then he saw that there was a market for his idea. One thing that he said is he doesnât try to solve problems in the beginning of the research and idea process. We are different in that way. I usually try to solve a problem for someone to see the market. Throughout this process, I did learn to be a lot more aware of everyday problems or run-ins and how easy solutions can be a business or monetized. Even adding in things to already offered services but charging a little more. One thing that didnât work that well for me is the fact that I can have these ideas but donât always have the resources or knowledge of what resources to use to make the ideas a reality. One thing I will take with me in my business is just because it is a small problem, doesnât mean there is always a large enough market to make the business idea worth pursuing. I really liked using ChatGPT. Before this class, I didnât know about it. I found it extremely useful and have already started using it in my business. ChatGPT is a great tool and can be used while still having academic integrity by using it to learn, not copying. I found these exercises helpful in being more aware of my surroundings but also a little difficult to come up with that many ideas. ",,,,,,,,Great work! Thanks for engaging with it and applying it to your personal/business circumstances. You're right a lack of knowledge and resources is often a problem in the process. Resource acquisition is a nother entrepreneurial skill that takes practice but usually involves activating your network to find those resources or to find resources and change their use or value.,,,
MS2,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"Brian Gramm emphasizes the importance of whole picture thinking when creating a 
company. His advice revolves around looking beyond the immediate product or service 
and considering the bigger picture. Gramm encourages entrepreneurs to meticulously 
assess the market for their product, delve into how money circulates within that market, 
and critically question the fundamental need for the proposed offering. By urging 
individuals to put themselves in the shoes of both a potential consumer and someone in
charge on the consumer end, he prompts a comprehensive analysis. This involves not 
only contemplating personal preferences but also evaluating whether there is a genuine 
and substantial demand for the product. In conclusion, this learning experience has 
been valuable in improving my ability to recognize entrepreneurial opportunities. The 
blend of theoretical knowledge, real-world examples, and active engagement 
contributed to a holistic learning process. The integration of tools like ChatGPT was 
beneficial, but it's crucial to balance its use with critical thinking and academic integrity. ",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
TS,0,Fall,Reflection,21,"I think overall I did pretty well, coming up with different opportunities over the last three weeks and actively trying to take notes from the podcast on how to come up with those ideas. I learned a lot over the last three weeks and definitely learned a little when it comes to coming up and trying to pick up on opportunities in everyday life. I think this will transfer over into life when I have to think of making a living off of one of my ideas. I didn't like the idea of chat gpt; I think it was to broad of ideas, no matter what I typed in for it to generate from. Lastly, I think you shouldnt change anything for the next class, I 100% learned from these activities.",,,,,,,,None Submitted,,,
AT,1,Fall,Reflection,21,"
To start, I really enjoyed using ChatGPT. I had no idea a resource like it even existed
before this course and it was definitely an asset each week. It was also fun and interesting to use
so it made the whole process enjoyable. ChatGPT tended to generate some solutions that I was
already familiar with but there were also a lot of solutions I had never heard of before. I could
definitely see myself using ChatGPT in the future, as needed, so Iâm excited to have been
introduced to it. It was very insightful and helped me to learn that there are always tons of
solutions to problems that donât seem within your control. Even if itâs an enormous problem,
there are still things that you can do. It helped me learn not to be discouraged or think that a
problem was too big for me to solve. Throughout the last three weeks, not only did I learn to
think like an Entrepreneur when it comes to seeing the problems and great experiences all around
you, I also learned to think of solutions and evaluate them in my mind, all at once. Through that,
I learned that Entrepreneurs do this process fast and automatically. Entrepreneurs are able to
come up with an idea for a business to solve a daily problem, and then evaluate it to see whether
or not it would work. I definitely think that the skills I learned from the daily practices will
follow me for the rest of my life and I hope to use them when it comes time to start my own
business.
I donât think that thereâs anything Iâd recommend changing about this exercise for the
next class. The only thing I can think of is maybe having students keep a journal where they do
these practices each week throughout the course. Then having them turn in their journal at the
end of the class rather than turning in each day. I found that aspect a little difficult but I found
that there was still flexibility as long as they were turned in. The only drawbacks to my
suggestion would be not having access to feedback and it would be difficult for some people to
stay accountable. But, I think that could be a more flexible solution for students. There were
many times Iâd witness something and want to write it down but didnât have access to pen and
paper. Then later on in the evening when it came time to complete the assignment, I forgot what I
wanted to add.",,,,,,,,Good job catching up!,,,

I listened to The Golden Circle TED Talk where Simon Sinek discussed why some
companies can sell what seems like the most basic things or things that sound like it is
the same as before. He discusses the way to explain their product to make the
customers feel meaningful and to help sales. I think in terms of âselling my productâ I was
doing the same thing Simon was trying to explain which is the what, how, why not the
why, how, what. I donât think listening to his discussions changed me much if at all, it
made me understand how manipulative advertising could be but in a further sense of
order, since advertising in its nature is manipulative. It seems that when you use the
limbic area of the brain you seem to make more rational decisions then the neocortex of
the brain. If you have a belief it can make you more productive in anything that you set
your mind to. I wasnât a fan of the ChatGPT exercises due to the ideas that ChatGPT
doesnt give very original problematic ideas in terms of them being ready for a product.
The benefit of using the ChatGPT is it is able to give you instant answers however the
answers feel and come off as very âpopularâ answers, I was getting answers that were
concerning a lot of the environment instead of answers concerning every aspect. The
only way I may use ChatGPT when forced to would be for ideas otherwise I wouldnât use
it at all for school.",,,,,,,,"The Ted talk wasn't one of the options for listening to podcast episodes. It sounds like I need to do a better job with the instructions.
